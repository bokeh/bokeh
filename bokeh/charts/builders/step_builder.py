    """ Create a line chart using :class:`LineBuilder <bokeh.charts.builder.line_builder.LineBuilder>` to
    render the geometry from values and index.

    Args:
        values (iterable): iterable 2d representing the data series
            values matrix.
        index (str|1d iterable, optional): can be used to specify a common custom
            index for all data series as an **1d iterable** of any sort that will be used as
            series common index or a **string** that corresponds to the key of the
            mapping to be used as index (and not as data series) if
            area.values is a mapping (like a dict, an OrderedDict
            or a pandas DataFrame)

    In addition the the parameters specific to this chart,
    :ref:`userguide_charts_generic_arguments` are also accepted as keyword parameters.

    Returns:
        a new :class:`Chart <bokeh.charts.Chart>`
