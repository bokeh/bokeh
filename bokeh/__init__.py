""" Bokeh is a Python interactive visualization library that targets modern
web browsers for presentation.

Its goal is to provide elegant, concise construction of novel graphics in the
style of d3.js, but also deliver this capability with high-performance
interactivity over very large or streaming datasets. Bokeh can help anyone
who would like to quickly and easily create interactive plots, dashboards,
and data applications.

def test(args=None):
    ''' Run the Bokeh unit tests under the bokeh python directory using ``py.test``.

    .. note::
        Does not run any BokehJS, examples, or integration tests.

    Args:
        args(list, optional): command line arguments accepted by ``py.test``

            For example, ``args=['-s', '-k charts']`` prevents capture of standard out
            and only runs tests that match ``"charts"``. For more ``py.test`` options
            see http://pytest.org/latest/usage.html.

    Returns:
