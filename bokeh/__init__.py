""" Bokeh is a Python interactive visualization library that targets modern
web browsers for presentation.

Its goal is to provide elegant, concise construction of novel graphics in the
style of d3.js, but also deliver this capability with high-performance
interactivity over very large or streaming datasets. Bokeh can help anyone
who would like to quickly and easily create interactive plots, dashboards,
and data applications.
