''' Provide special versions of list and dict, that can automatically notify
about changes when used for property values.

Mutations to these values are detected, and the properties owning the
collection is notified of the changes. Consider the following model
definition:

.. code-block:: python

    class SomeModel(Model):

        options = List(String)

If we have an instance of this model, ``m`` then we can set the entire
value of the ``options`` property at once:

.. code-block:: python

    m.options = ["foo", "bar"]

When we do this in the context of a Bokeh server application that is being
viewed in a browser, this change is automatically noticed, and the
corresponding BokehJS property in the browser is synchronized, possibly
causing some change in the visual state of the application in the browser.

But it is also desirable that changes *inside* the ``options`` list also
be detected. That is, the following kinds of operations should also be
automatically synchronized between BokehJS and a Bokeh server:

.. code-block:: python

    m.options.append("baz")

    m.options[2] = "quux"

    m.options.insert(0, "bar")

The classes in this module provide this functionality.

.. note::
    These classes form part of the very low-level machinery that implements
    the Bokeh model and property system. It is unlikely that any of these
    classes or their methods will be applicable to any standard usage or to
    anyone who is not directly developing on Bokeh's own infrastructure.
