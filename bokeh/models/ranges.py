    Users will normally supply categorical values directly:

    .. code-block:: python

        p.circle(x=["foo", "bar"], ...)

    BokehJS will create a mapping from ``"foo"`` and ``"bar"`` to a numerical
    coordinate system called *synthetic coordinates*. In the simplest cases,
    factors are separated by a distance of 1.0 in synthetic coordinates,
    however the exact mapping from factors to synthetic coordinates is
    affected by he padding properties as well as whether the number of levels
    the factors have.

    Users typically do not need to worry about the details of this mapping,
    however it can be useful to fine tune positions by adding offsets. When
    supplying factors as coordinates or values, it is possible to add an
    offset in the synthetic coordinate space by adding a final number value
    to a factor tuple. For example:

    .. code-block:: python

        p.circle(x=[("foo", 0.3), ...], ...)

    will position the first circle at an ``x`` position that is offset by
    adding 0.3 to the synthetic coordinate for ``"foo"``.

    simply a string. For example:

    .. code-block: python

        FactorRange(factors=["sales", "marketing", "engineering"])

    defines a range with three simple factors that might represent different
    units of a business.

            ["2017", "sales'], ["2017", "marketing'], ["2017", "engineering"],
        ])

    defines a range with six 2-level factors that might represent the three
    business units, grouped by year.

    Note that factors and sub-factors *may only be strings*.
