        Causes the result to be preceded with a plus or minus sign on numeric
        values. By default, only the ``-`` sign is used on negative numbers.

    * An optional padding specifier
        Specifies what (if any) character to use for padding. Possible values
        are 0 or any other character precedeed by a ``'`` (single quote). The
        default is to pad with spaces.

    * An optional ``-`` sign
        Causes sprintf to left-align the result of this placeholder. The default
        is to right-align the result.

    * An optional number
        Specifies how many characters the result should have. If the value to be
        returned is shorter than this number, the result will be padded.

    * An optional precision modifier
        Consists of a ``.`` (dot) followed by a number, specifies how many digits
        should be displayed for floating point numbers. When used on a string, it
        causes the result to be truncated.

    * A type specifier
        Can be any of:

        - ``%`` --- yields a literal ``%`` character
        - ``b`` --- yields an integer as a binary number
        - ``c`` --- yields an integer as the character with that ASCII value
        - ``d`` or ``i`` --- yields an integer as a signed decimal number
        - ``e`` --- yields a float using scientific notation
        - ``u`` --- yields an integer as an unsigned decimal number
        - ``f`` --- yields a float as is
        - ``o`` --- yields an integer as an octal number
        - ``s`` --- yields a string as is

        been tested exhaustively against this list. If you find formats
        that do not function as expected, please submit a `github issue`,
        so that the documentation can be updated appropriately.

    %a
        The abbreviated name of the day of the week according to the
        current locale.

    %A
        The full name of the day of the week according to the current
        locale.

    %b
        The abbreviated month name according to the current locale.

    %B
        The full month name according to the current locale.

    %c
        The preferred date and time representation for the current
        locale.

    %C
        The century number (year/100) as a 2-digit integer.

    %d
        The day of the month as a decimal number (range 01 to 31).

    %D
        Equivalent to %m/%d/%y.  (Americans should note that in many
        other countries %d/%m/%y is rather common. This means that in
        international context this format is ambiguous and should not
        be used.)

    %e
        Like %d, the day of the month as a decimal number, but a
        leading zero is replaced by a space.

    %F
        Equivalent to %Y-%m-%d (the ISO 8601 date format).

    %G
        The ISO 8601 week-based year with century as a decimal number.
        The 4-digit year corresponding to the ISO week number (see %V).
        This has the same format and value as %Y, except that if the
        ISO week number belongs to the previous or next year, that year
        is used instead.

    %g
        Like %G, but without century, that is, with a 2-digit year (00-99).

    %h
        Equivalent to %b.

    %H
        The hour as a decimal number using a 24-hour clock (range 00
        to 23).

    %I
        The hour as a decimal number using a 12-hour clock (range 01
        to 12).

    %j
        The day of the year as a decimal number (range 001 to 366).

    %k
        The hour (24-hour clock) as a decimal number (range 0 to 23).
        Single digits are preceded by a blank.  (See also %H.)

    %l
        The hour (12-hour clock) as a decimal number (range 1 to 12).
        Single digits are preceded by a blank.  (See also %I.)  (TZ)

    %m
        The month as a decimal number (range 01 to 12).

    %M
        The minute as a decimal number (range 00 to 59).

    %n
        A newline character.

    %p
        Either "AM" or "PM" according to the given time value, or the
        corresponding strings for the current locale.  Noon is treated
        as "PM" and midnight as "AM".

    %P
        Like %p but in lowercase: "am" or "pm" or a corresponding
        string for the current locale.

    %r
        The time in a.m. or p.m. notation.  In the POSIX locale this
        is equivalent to %I:%M:%S %p.

    %R
        The time in 24-hour notation (%H:%M). For a version including
        the seconds, see %T below.

    %s
        The number of seconds since the Epoch, 1970-01-01 00:00:00
        +0000 (UTC).

    %S
        The second as a decimal number (range 00 to 60).  (The range
        is up to 60 to allow for occasional leap seconds.)

    %t
        A tab character.

    %T
        The time in 24-hour notation (%H:%M:%S).

    %u
        The day of the week as a decimal, range 1 to 7, Monday being 1.
        See also %w.

    %U
        The week number of the current year as a decimal number, range
        00 to 53, starting with the first Sunday as the first day of
        week 01.  See also %V and %W.

    %V
        The ISO 8601 week number (see NOTES) of the current year as a
        decimal number, range 01 to 53, where week 1 is the first week
        that has at least 4 days in the new year.  See also %U and %W.

    %w
        The day of the week as a decimal, range 0 to 6, Sunday being 0.
        See also %u.

    %W
        The week number of the current year as a decimal number, range
        00 to 53, starting with the first Monday as the first day of
        week 01.

    %x
        The preferred date representation for the current locale
        without the time.

    %X
        The preferred time representation for the current locale
        without the date.

    %y
        The year as a decimal number without a century (range 00 to 99).

    %Y
        The year as a decimal number including the century.

    %z
        The +hhmm or -hhmm numeric timezone (that is, the hour and
        minute offset from UTC).

    %Z
        The timezone name or abbreviation.

    %%
        A literal '%' character.
