''' Provide Bokeh model "building block" classes.

One of the central design principals of Bokeh is that, regardless of
how the plot creation code is spelled in Python (or other languages),
the result is an object graph that encompasses all the visual and
data aspects of the scene. Furthermore, this *scene graph* is to be
serialized, and it is this serialized graph that the client library
BokehJS uses to render the plot. The low-level objects that comprise
a Bokeh scene graph are called :ref:`Models <bokeh.model>`.
