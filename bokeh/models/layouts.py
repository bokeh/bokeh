    `box` mode constrains both the height and width. The items being laid out
    attempt to fit entirely within the window. Items will shrink and grow with both
    the height and width of the browser window changing. This is sometimes called outside-in.
    This is a typical behavior for desktop applications.

    `width` mode constrains only the width. The items being laid out will resize to
    fit the width and will take up whatever vertical space they may need. This is a
    typical behavior for modern websites.

    `fixed` mode prevents responsiveness. The items will have a fixed size.
