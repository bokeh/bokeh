This directory contains examples which can be easily loaded to bokeh-server.
To perform such action just use the 'load_document' function and feed it with
file name - that's the only required argument (omit '.py' extension).

All examples should have 'output_server("test_document")' line inside them.
Additionally do not insert 'show()' command at the end.
