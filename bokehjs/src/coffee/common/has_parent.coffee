# hasparent
# display_options can be passed down to children
# defaults for display_options should be placed
# in a class var display_defaults
# the get function, will resolve an instances defaults first
# then check the parents actual val, and finally check class defaults.
# display options cannot go into defaults

# defaults vs display_defaults
# backbone already has a system for attribute defaults, however we wanted to
# impose a secondary inheritance system for attributes based on GUI hierarchies
# the idea being that you generally want to inherit UI attributes from
# your container/parent.  Here is how we do this.
# HasParent models can have a parent attribute, which is our
# continuum reference.  when we try to get an attribute, first we try to
# get the attribute via super (so try properties, and if not that, normal
# backbone resolution) if that results in something which is undefined,
# then try to grab the attribute from the parent.

# the reason why we need to segregate display_defaults into a separate object
# form backbones normal default is because backbone defaults are automatically
# set on the object, so you have no way of knowing whether the attr exists
# because it was a default, or whether it was intentionally set.  In the
# parent case, we want to try parent settings BEFORE we rely on
# display defaults.

# functionally, since this is mostly there to facilitate deferred lookups,
# perhaps a name besides display_defaults would be appropriate, we might want
# to store non-display related defaults here.
