    # ####Parameters
    # * modelspecs : list of models in json form, looking like this

    #         type : 'Plot'

    #           name : 'myplot'
    #           s : []
    #
    #   type is the key of the in collections for this model
    #   id is the id of this model
    #   attributes are the attributes of the model

    # ####Returns
    #
    # * null
