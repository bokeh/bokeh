Examples in this directory show off bokeh's capability to integrate with Jupyer widgets
outside of JupyerLab or classical Notebook environments. All examples are bokeh server
examples, so you run them with `bokeh server app_name`, and then you have to navigate
to `http://localhost:5006/app_name`:

* `ipyvolume_camera.py` -- shows how to integrate a thridparty widget and manipulate it
with Bokeh's and IPyWidgets' controls.

* `ipyleaflet_tiles.py` -- IPyLeaflet and Bokeh's tile renderer side-by-side.
