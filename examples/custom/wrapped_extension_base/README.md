This example uses a custom extension, which requires compilation before
the example can be run. Issue ``bokeh build latex_label`` to build the
extension.

Note: Bokeh supports LaTeX natively on several elements. The purpose of this
example is to demonstrate how to use a custom extension. For more information
about using LaTeX in Bokeh, see ['Adding mathematical notations' in the user guide]
(https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide/styling.html#adding-mathematical-notations).
