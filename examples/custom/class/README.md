Sometimes is it convenient to add custom HTML classes to tags generated by Bokeh (i.e. for creating a custom CSS for a single element only).

Until proper support will be added (#5471) it is possible to properly extend Bokeh element View by adding a custom class.

Current example demonstrates how to added custom HTML classes to derived Row/Column layouts.
