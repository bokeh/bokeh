This document lists examples in this directory that are usefull for
testing WebGL functionality. Please make sure that these examples
run successfully after significant changes in BokehJS.

Examples usefull for testing:

- line_compare.py - puts regular and webgl line glyphs side by side
- line10k.py - uses the webgl line glyph
- scatter10k - uses the webgl circle glyph and selections
- iris_blend.py - to test color names and blending of semi-transparent glyphs

Other examples that explicitly make use of WebGL, but are not that
interesting from a testing perspective:
    
- clustering.py
