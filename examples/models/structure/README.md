The examples in this directory illustrate the use of some tools that can assist in the
development of bokeh plots.  Currently this includes:

* a tool for constructing the directed graph of submodels of a bokeh model
and drawing that graph to illuminate the model structure. Run

```
$ python structure_graph.py
```

The [jupyter notebook](./ModelStructureExample.ipynb) illustrates this and gives a look
into some of the private methods that provide the information that builds the structure graph.
