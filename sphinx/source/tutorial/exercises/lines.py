# EXERCISE: reproduce the above plot for one of the other spirals

# Let's try to put all lines on one plot for comparison. First we need to
# turn on `hold` so that each renderer does not create a brand new plot
hold()

# Next we need to actually create a new figure, so that the following
# renderers work on a new plot, and not the last one.
figure()

# EXERCISE: add all four spirals to one plot, each with different line colors
# and legend values. NOTE: title only set on the first renderer.

# OK, so that doesn't look so good because Bokeh tried to autoscale to
# accomodate all the data. We can use the Range1d object to set the plot range
# explicitly

# EXERCISE: create a new figure

# EXERCISE: add x_range and y_range parameters to the first `line`, to set the
# range to [-10, 10]. NOTE: Range1d are created like: Range1d(start=0, end=-10)

show()      # show the plot
