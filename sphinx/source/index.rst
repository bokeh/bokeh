Welcome to Bokeh
================

.. _about:

Bokeh is a Python interactive visualization library that targets modern
web browsers for presentation. Its goal is to provide elegant, concise
construction of novel graphics in the style of D3.js, and to extend this
capability with high-performance interactivity over very large or streaming
datasets. Bokeh can help anyone who would like to quickly and easily create
interactive plots, dashboards, and data applications.

To get started using Bokeh to make your visualizations, see the
:ref:`userguide`.

To see examples of how you might use Bokeh with your own data, check out
the :ref:`gallery`.

A complete API reference of Bokeh is at :ref:`refguide`.

If you are interested in contributing to Bokeh, or extending the library, see
the :ref:`devguide`.
