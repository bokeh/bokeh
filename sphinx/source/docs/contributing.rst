============

We are always looking for contributors, and want grow the developer/contributor
base for Bokeh.

If you are the author of an existing plotting library and would like your
interfaces to generate output that can be rendered by the :ref:`bokehjs`
runtime, take a look through the :ref:`devguide` and we'd love to help you out.

If you have a data API or other web-based tool that you think would be great
to have available by default in Bokeh, we would be excited to make it available
as a plug-in in Bokeh.

If you are a JavaScript developer and want to help us make Bokeh easier to use
on the JavaScript side, and plug in more nicely with libraries like Angular or
Dart, please get in touch.

If you are a designer and you want to help us build out a great set of default
styles for our plots, we can definitely use your help!

And lastly, if you have built a nice plot or live visualization app with Bokeh
and want us to showcase it in our user-submitted gallery, let us know!

Specific areas we'd like to get help on:

* Mobile & touch platforms
* IE support
* Interactive widget library
* WebGL and 3D integration
* Designs & styling
* Canvas performance optimization
* Connectors to various data APIs (public data or even commercial software suites)
