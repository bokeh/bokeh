0.12.6 (May 2017)
=================

Bokeh Version ``0.12.6`` is an incremental update that adds a few important
features and fixes several bugs. Some of the highlights include:

Migration Guide
---------------

As the project approaches a 1.0 release, it is necessary to make some changes
to bring interfaces and functionality up to a point that can be maintained
long-term. We try to limit such changes as much as possible, and have a
period of deprecation.

Deprecations removed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All previous deprecations up to ``0.12.3`` have be removed. Below is the
complete list of removals.

* Deprecated ``Legend`` properties: ``legends``, ``legend_margin``,
  ``legend_padding``, ``legend_spacing`` have been removed.
* Deprecated ``DatetimeTickFormatter.formats`` dict property has been removed.
* ``Tool`` dimensions specified as a list value rather than an enum, are no
  longer accepted.
* Deprecated ``Button.type`` property has been removed.

Scales Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following BokehJS classes have been moved and renamed:

============================== ==============================
Old                            New
============================== ==============================
``mappers/LinearMapper``       ``scales/LinearScale``
``mappers/LogMapper``          ``scales/LogScale``
``mappers/CategoricalMapper``  ``scales/CategoricalScale``
============================== ==============================

Previously, these classes were internal implementation details. These changes
are not expected to impact any user code.

Additionally, these new scales models are now accessible from the Python.

As part of this work, some BokehJS attributes were renamed to be consistent
with the new terminology:

============================== ==============================
Old                            New
============================== ==============================
``CartesianFrame.x_mappers``   ``CartesianFrame.xscales``
``CartesianFrame.y_mappers``   ``CartesianFrame.yscales``
``GlyphRenderer.xmapper``      ``GlyphRenderer.xscale``
``GlyphRenderer.ymapper``      ``GlyphRenderer.yscale``
============================== ==============================

Since these attributes may be present in user code (e.g CustomJS callbacks
or extensions), the old names will continue to work for some time, with a
deprecation warning in the JS console.

New signaling API
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Previously we used Backbone events for communication between bokehjs' objects.
This was changed to a new type-safe API. This change mostly affects contributors
to bokehjs and writers of extensions.

===================================== ==============================================
Old                                   New
===================================== ==============================================

``@listenTo(obj, "change", fn)``      ``@connect(obj.change, fn)``
``@listenTo(obj, "change:attr", fn)`` ``@connect(obj.properties.attr.change, fn)``
``obj.trigger("change", arg)``        ``obj.change.emit(arg)``
``obj.trigger("change:attr", arg)``   ``obj.properties.attr.change.emit(arg)``
