0.12.6 (May 2017)
=================

Bokeh Version ``0.12.6`` is an incremental update that adds a few important
features and fixes several bugs. Some of the highlights include:

Migration Guide
---------------

As the project approaches a 1.0 release, it is necessary to make some changes
to bring interfaces and functionality up to a point that can be maintained
long-term. We try to limit such changes as much as possible, and have a
period of deprecation.

New Deprecations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``Plot.webgl`` property has been deprecated in place of
``Plot.output_backend`` in order to avoid conflicts between WebGL and a new
SVG backend.

Deprecations removed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All previous deprecations up to ``0.12.3`` have be removed. Below is the
complete list of removals.

* Deprecated ``Legend`` properties: ``legends``, ``legend_margin``,
  ``legend_padding``, ``legend_spacing`` have been removed.
* Deprecated ``DatetimeTickFormatter.formats`` dict property has been removed.
* ``Tool`` dimensions specified as a list value rather than an enum, are no
  longer accepted.
* Deprecated ``Button.type`` property has been removed.

Scales Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following BokehJS classes have been moved and renamed:

============================== ==============================
Old                            New
============================== ==============================
``mappers/LinearMapper``       ``scales/LinearScale``
``mappers/LogMapper``          ``scales/LogScale``
``mappers/CategoricalMapper``  ``scales/CategoricalScale``
============================== ==============================

Previously, these Mapper classes were internal implementation details. The
new Scale classes are first-class Bokeh models and are accessible from
Python. This was done to facilitate future work supporting custom, user-defined
scales.

There is a new Plot validation check to ensure that Scales and Ranges
on a dimension are compatible. By default, ``Plot`` models are configured with
``LinearScale`` models which (along with ``LogScale`` models) are compatible
with ``Range1d`` and ``DataRange1d`` range models.

One inevitable breaking change is that users employing a ``FactorRange`` in
the ``bokeh.model`` API will have to specify a ``CategoricalScale`` on the same
dimension. For example:

.. code-block:: python

    plot = Plot()
    plot.x_range = DataRange1d()
    plot.y_range = FactorRange(["Mon", "Tues", "Wed", "Thurs", "Fri"])
    plot.y_scale = CategoricalScale()

The ``bokeh.plotting.figure`` function should this range and scale
compatibility handling automagically in most cases.

As part of this work, some BokehJS attributes were renamed to be consistent
with the new terminology:

============================== ==============================
Old                            New
============================== ==============================
``CartesianFrame.x_mappers``   ``CartesianFrame.xscales``
``CartesianFrame.y_mappers``   ``CartesianFrame.yscales``
``GlyphRenderer.xmapper``      ``GlyphRenderer.xscale``
``GlyphRenderer.ymapper``      ``GlyphRenderer.yscale``
============================== ==============================

Since these attributes may be present in user code (e.g CustomJS callbacks
or extensions), the old names will continue to work for some time, with a
deprecation warning in the JS console.

New signaling API
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Previously we used Backbone events for communication between bokehjs' objects.
This was changed to a new type-safe API. This change primarily affects
contributors working on BokehJS and writers of extensions.

===================================== ==============================================
Old                                   New
===================================== ==============================================

``@listenTo(obj, "change", fn)``      ``@connect(obj.change, fn)``
``@listenTo(obj, "change:attr", fn)`` ``@connect(obj.properties.attr.change, fn)``
``obj.trigger("change", arg)``        ``obj.change.emit(arg)``
``obj.trigger("change:attr", arg)``   ``obj.properties.attr.change.emit(arg)``

Python datetime handling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Bokeh has not handled Python datetime values consistently with NumPy
``datetime64``. Bokeh aims to treat all datetime values "as-is", but in some
cases a local timezone conversion could affect Python datetime values. This
has been corrected. In case there is code that depends on the erroneous
behavior, please note that the new behavior is effective immediately and is
now maintained under test to be consistent with NumPy values. See the issue
https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/issues/5499 for more details.
