Migration Guide
---------------

* Range update callbacks now return the range object as cb_obj (not the plot)
* Layouts (HBox, VBox, VBoxForm) have been moved from bokeh.models.widgets to
  bokeh.models.layouts, but continue to be importable from bokeh.models
* BlazeDataSource has been removed; it will be maintained by the Blaze team
  in the future.
* The broken BokehJS API has been removed. We are actively seeking a
  champion/maintainer for a new BokehJS API.
