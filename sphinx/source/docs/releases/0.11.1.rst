0.11.1 (Feb 2016)
=================

This release was focused on providing several bug fixes and documentation
improvements from the Jan 2016 0.11.0 release.

Migration notes:

* Range update callbacks now return the range object as the cb_obj (not the plot)
* Layouts (HBox, VBox, VBoxForm) have been moved from bokeh.models.widgets to
  bokeh.models.layouts
