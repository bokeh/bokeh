Migration Guide
---------------

NOTE: the 0.12.x series is the last planned release series before a version
1.0 release. For more information see the `project roadmap`_.

Deprecations Removed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following previous deprecations have been removed:

* ``app_path`` from functions in ``bokeh.client.session`` and ``bokeh.embed``
* ``standalone_html_page_for_models`` from ``bokeh.embed``
* ``'patch'`` and ``'stream'`` event names (use ``'patching'`` and ``'streaming'``)
* ``webgl``, ``x_mapper_type``, ``y_mapper_type``, and ``tool_events`` from ``Plot``
* Glyphs methods now only accept either all sequence literals, OR all column names
* ``ResizeTool`` (previously made a no-op) has been removed

New Deprecations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The boolean ``responsive`` parameter to ``Figure`` and ``bokeh.layouts`` has
been deprecated. The ``sizing_mode`` enum should be used instead. Use
``sizing_mode='fixed'`` for ``responsive=False`` and
``sizing_mode='scale_width'`` for ``responsive=True`` instead.

The function ``bokeh.sampledata.population.load_population`` has been
deprecated. Use the attribute ``bokeh.sampledata.population.data`` instead.

Code Moves
~~~~~~~~~~

The module ``bokeh.util.notebook`` has been deprecated. The functions it
contains have been moved to ``bokeh.io.notebook``.

The function ``bokeh.io.set_curdoc`` is now ``bokeh.io.doc.set_curdoc``.

Named color *objects* now live in ``bokeh.colors.named`` instead of directly in
``bokeh.colors``. Additionally color utilities such as ``NamedColor`` have been
moved inside the package, and marked as internal API. Using string names for
colors works exactly as before.

Dead Code Removal
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following unused code was removed immediately:

* ``Aggregation`` from ``bokeh.core.enums``
* PyPy detection functions from ``bokeh.util``
* Zeppelin related code (support should come from external notebook hook)

Additionally the attribute ``bokeh.__base_version__`` was removed. Computing
it at all times made importing Bokeh take substantial fractions of a second
longer than necessary. It is not expected this change should affect any
users, but if you need this value, the ``bokeh.util.version.base_version``
function can be used.
