BokehJS Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

BokehJS doesn't require custom styles to make "responsive" layout modes work
anymore. This means that there are no additional styles added a page, like
margins. This results in margins working differently and now default to browser
defaults. If you want to restore the previous behavior, then add the following
to your HTML:

.. code-block:: html

    <style>
      html {
        width: 100%;
        height: 100%;
      }
      body {
        width: 90%;
        height: 100%;
        margin: auto;
      }
    </style>
