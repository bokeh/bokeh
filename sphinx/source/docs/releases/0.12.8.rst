Migration Guide
---------------

NOTE: the 0.12.x series is the last planned release series before a version
1.0 release. For more information see the `project roadmap`_.

Deprecated ``bokeh.charts`` support removed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``bokeh.charts`` module, which was simply a compatibility shim to load the
separate ``bkcharts` package, has been removed. Additionlaly, Bokeh itself no
longer lists ``bkcharts`` as a dependency. In order to continue using
``bkcharts`` code, the ``bkcharts`` package must be installed separately.

MPL compatibility removed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``bokeh.mpl`` module and all supporting code in ``bokeh.core.compat`` has
been removed. Bokeh no longer offers or attempts any automatic MPL conversion.
