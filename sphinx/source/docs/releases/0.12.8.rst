Deprecated ``bokeh.charts`` support removed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``bokeh.charts`` module, which was simply a compatibility shim to load the
separate ``bkcharts` package, has been removed. Additionlaly, Bokeh itself no
longer lists ``bkcharts`` as a dependency. In order to continue using
``bkcharts`` code, the ``bkcharts`` package must be installed separately.
