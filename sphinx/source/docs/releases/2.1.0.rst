-----------------------------------------------------------

``render_mode`` in ``BoxAnnotation``, ``Span``, etc.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Certain annotations like ``BoxAnnotation`` or ``Span`` supported dual canvas
and CSS rendering modes, primarily for performance reasons, when used as
overlays. Overlays are now implemented efficiently on the HTML5 canvas and
thus CSS mode and ``render_mode`` property aren't needed anymore and have
been deprecated. They will be removed in bokeh 3.0.
