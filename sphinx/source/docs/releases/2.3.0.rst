-----------------------------------------------------------

``ArrowHead`` is not an annotation anymore
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``ArrowHead`` used to inherit from ``Annotation`` base class, but was never
intended to work like one and didn't fully implement its protocol. After this
change you won't be able to use properties like ``level``, ``x_range_name``,
etc., but those wheren't respected by renderers anyway.
