.. _release-2-3-0-migration:

`Migration Guide <releases.html#release-2-3-0-migration>`__
-----------------------------------------------------------

``ArrowHead`` is not an annotation anymore
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``ArrowHead`` used to inherit from ``Annotation`` base class, but was never
intended to work like one and didn't fully implement its protocol. After this
change you won't be able to use properties like ``level``, ``x_range_name``,
etc., but those wheren't respected by renderers anyway.

Renamed bokeh's base models
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Certain base models were renamed to unify naming convention with bokehjs:

+---------------+-------------------+
| Old name      | New name          |
+===============+===================+
| ``WebSource`` | ``WebDataSource`` |
+---------------+-------------------+
| ``Action``    | ``ActionTool``    |
+---------------+-------------------+
| ``Gesture``   | ``GestureTool``   |
+---------------+-------------------+
| ``Inspect``   | ``InspectTool``   |
+---------------+-------------------+

Old names are deprecated and will be removed in bokeh 3.0.

``names`` properties were deprecated
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``DataRange.names``, ``SelectTool.names`` and ``HoverTool.names`` were deprecated
and will be removed in bokeh 3.0. Use respective ``renderers`` properties instead,
possibly in combination with ``plot.select(name="renderer name")``.

bokehjs' visuals have different semantics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Previously ``Line``, ``Fill``, ``Text`` and ``Hatch`` visuals were used in primitive,
scalar and vector contexts. Those were split and now context-specific visuals, e.g.,
``Line``, ``LineScalar`` and ``LineVector`` have to used in respective contexts. This
aligns visuals with mixins, among other things.

Marker models are deprecated
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Models like ``Asterisk``, ``CircleX``, ``X``, etc. are deprecated in bokeh. Use
``Scatter`` glyph with respective marker types instead, e.g. replace ``Asterisk()``
with ``Scatter(marker="asterisk")``. Marker methods on ``Figure`` will default to
use ``Scatter`` glyph. Marker models were removed from bokehjs.

``EditTool.custom_tooltip``, ``HelpTool.help_tooltip`` and ``CustomAction.action_tooltip`` were deprecated
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use ``Tool.description`` instead, which can also be used with all other types tools.

``ColorBar``'s ``orientation``, ``ticker`` and ``formatter`` default to ``"auto"``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Previously those properties had concrete defaults (``"vertical"``, ``BasicTicker()`` and
``BasicTickFormatter()`` respectively). In most cases this shouldn't affect users' code.
However, if you relied on setting e.g. ``color_bar.ticker.base = 60``, then the code will
need to be repaced with ``color_bar.ticker = BasicTicker(base=60)``.

``CartesianFrame`` is not a layout anymore
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This only affects extension creators. ``CartesianFrame`` is now responsible only for maintaing
the coordinate system of a plot. Use the plot's ``layout.center_panel`` to access any layout
related capability. Note you can still use ``CartesianFrame.bbox``, so most code doesn't change.
