Release History
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To support publishing all release information on one page, the
``bokeh_index_toctree`` module and contents have been immediately moved to
``bokeh_releases``. Since this facility had no use outside building
official Bokeh documenation, no deprecation was given.

CDS ``column_names`` property
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

ColumnDataSource models had a Bokeh property ``column_names`` for specifying
the list of column names in ``source.data``. This information was duplicative
and had to be explicitly maintained in a fragile way. It has been replaced by
read-only properties in both Python and JavaScript that always accurately
report the current column names automatically. Setting ``column_names`` is
no longer supported, however as this possibility has never been officially
documented or demonstrated, it is not expected to affect any standard usage.
