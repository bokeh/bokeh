-----------------------------------------------------------

Minimum Package Versions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This release raises the minimum version for some packages

* Bokeh now requires Python 3.7 or higher.

Deprecations
~~~~~~~~~~~~

``ScreenDistanceSpec`` and ``DataDistanceSpec`` are deprecated, and now return
a ``SizeSpec``. Custom extensions using these should use ``SizeSpec`` instead.

``PropertyUnitsSpec`` is deprecated. Use ``UnitsSpec`` instead (this is unlikely
to impact any typical usage).

Units Properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Units properties must now be configured with an ``units_enum`` that is an
``enumeration`` instead of a ``units_type`` that is an ``Enum`` property:

.. code:: python

    units_enum=SpatialUnits # use this

    units_type=Enum(SpatialUnits) # NOT this

This is only of potential interest to custom extensions.
