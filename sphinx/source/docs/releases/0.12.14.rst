Migration Guide
---------------

NOTE: the 0.12.x series is the last planned release series before a version
1.0 release. For more information see the `project roadmap`_.

MercatorTileSource change
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`MercatorTileSource` models previously snapped to the closest zoom
level resulting in user supplied axis ranges to be largely
ignored. The default behavior has now been changed from snapping to
the closest zoom level to simply maintaining the correct aspect ratio,
while keeping the user defined bounds contained within the axis
ranges.

The old behavior may be restored by setting enabling the `snap_to_zoom`
property.
