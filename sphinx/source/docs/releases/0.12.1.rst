0.12.1 (Jul 2016)
=================

Bokeh Version ``0.12.1`` is a minor, incremental update that adds a few new
small features and fixes several bugs. Some of the highlights include:

* Add ``.patch`` method to ``ColumnDataSource`` for efficient partial updates.
* Add ``.visible`` property to all glyphs for easy on/off capability.
* Add qualitative Brewer colormapps to ``bokeh.palettes``.
* Add new ``VBar`` and ``HBar`` glyph types.
* Update BokehJS to use use RBush 2.0.1 for more efficient spatial indexing.
* Restore ``ResizeTool`` functionality for simple layouts.
* Fix Windows support for conda build, docs build, and running unit tests.
* Fix a bug in the HTML template for ``autoload_server`` causing incorrect layouts.
* Fix a bug in the toolbar CSS, causing it to interfere with hit testing and selection.
* Fix WebGL support for Safari, and WebGL bug affecting line thickness.
* Fix intermittent issues with BokehJS loading in Jupyter notebooks.

NOTE: the 0.12.x series is the last planned release series before a
version 1.0 release. The focus of the 1.0 release will be implementing
build automation to enforce API stability, and a very small number of
high value features.
