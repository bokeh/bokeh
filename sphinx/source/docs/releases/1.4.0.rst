Deprecations
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The overburdened ``legend`` keyword argument to glyph methods is deprecated. It
is replaced with three purpose-specific keyword arguments:

* ``legend_label="some_label"``

    This will always produce a legend item with exactly the given label.

* ``legend_field="some_colname"``

    This will produce a "grouped" legend, where the grouping is done by
    JavaScript in the browser. Python code will only see a single legend item
    representing the grouping.

* ``legend_group="some_colname"``

    This will produce a "grouped" legend, where the grouping is done by *Python*
    code, bedore the content is rendered in the browser. Python code will see
    individual legend items for each group.

These keywords remove the ambiguities due to the "automagic" operation of
``legend`` with respect to legend grouping. The existing ``legend`` keyword
argument will continue to function until at least version 3.0 of Bokeh.
