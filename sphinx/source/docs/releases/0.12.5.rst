0.12.5 (XYZ 2017)
=================

Bokeh Version ``0.12.5`` is an incremental update that adds a few important
features and fixes several bugs. Some of the highlights include:


Many other small bugfixes and docs additions. For full details see the
:bokeh-tree:`CHANGELOG`.

NOTE: the 0.12.x series is the last planned release series before a
version 1.0 release. The focus of the 1.0 release will be implementing
build automation to enforce API stability, and a very small number of
high value features. For more information see the `project roadmap`_.

Migration Guide
---------------

As the project approaches a 1.0 release, it is necessary to make some changes
to bring interfaces and functionality up to a point that can be maintained
long-term. We try to limit such changes as much as possible, and have a
period of deprecation.

Deprecations removed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All previous deprecations up to ``0.12.0`` have be removed. Below is the
complete list of removals.

Modules and functions and classes that have been removed:

============================ ========================== ===================================
Functions Removed            Modules Removed            Classes Removed
============================ ========================== ===================================
``bokeh.embed.components``   ``bokeh.browserlib``       ``bokeh.core.properties.TitleProp``
``bokeh.charts.hplot``       ``bokeh.mixins``           ``bokeh.models.layouts.GridPlot``
``bokeh.charts.vplot``       ``bokeh.plotting_helpers`` ``bokeh.models.layouts.VBoxForm``
``bokeh.io.hplot``           ``bokeh.properties``
``bokeh.io.hplot``           ``bokeh.templates``
``bokeh.io.vform``
``bokeh.plotting.hplot``
``bokeh.plotting.vplot``
============================ ========================== ===================================

The methods ``bokeh.document.add`` and ``push_notebook`` of
``ColumnDataSource`` have been removed.

Additionally, the property ``bokeh.charts.builder.Builder.sort_legend`` was
removed, as well as the following properties of ``Plot``

* ``border_fill``
* ``background_fill``
* ``logo``
* ``responsive``
* ``title_text_align``
* ``title_text_alpha``
* ``title_text_baseline``
* ``title_text_color``
* ``title_text_font``
* ``title_text_font_size``

Document and Model Refactoring
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order that ``document.py`` and ``models.py`` only contain things that might
be of usual interest to users, some changes and rearrangements were made.

The ``abstract`` class decorator was moved from ``models.py`` to
``has_props.py``. The class decorator now also adds an admonition to the
docstring of any class marked abstract that it is not useful to instantiate
directly.

The metaclass ``Viewable`` has been renamed to ``MetaModel``.

The ``document.py`` module has been split up, and parts that would not be of
normal interest to most users have been moved to better locations.

These changes are not expected to impact user code in any way. For complete
details see :bokeh-pull:`5786`.

JQuery and underscore.js removed from BokehJS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

JQuery has been removed as a build dependency of BokehJS. The variable
`Bokeh.$` is no longer available. If you require JQuery (i.e. for a custom
extension or when using the JavaScript API) you will need to provide it
explicitly.

underscore.js has been removed as a build dependency of BokehJS. The variable
`Bokeh._` is no longer available. If you require underscore.js (i.e. for a
custom extension or when using the JavaScript API) you will need to provide it
explicitly.

Both of these removals together result in a ~10% reduction in the size of
the minified BokehJS library.

Default tooltip position for lines changed to nearest point
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When showing tooltips for lines, the new default is to label the nearest point,
instead of the previous point, which used to be the default.

HTTP Request information for apps limited to query arguments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``request`` previously attribute was added to session contexts as a way to
expose HTTP query parameters. It was discovered that providing the entire
request is not compatible with the usage of ``--num-procs``. A method was
found to satisfy the original feature request for query arguments, together
with ``--num-procs`` (but *only* for query arguments). Accordingly the only
attribute that can now be accessed on ``request`` is ``.arguments``, e.g.:

.. code-block:: python

    curdoc().session_context.request.arguments

Attempting to access any other attribute on ``request`` will result in an
error.
