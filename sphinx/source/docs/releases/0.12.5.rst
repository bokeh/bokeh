0.12.5 (XYZ 2017)
=================

Bokeh Version ``0.12.5`` is an incremental update that adds a few important
features and fixes several bugs. Some of the highlights include:


Many other small bugfixes and docs additions. For full details see the
:bokeh-tree:`CHANGELOG`.

NOTE: the 0.12.x series is the last planned release series before a
version 1.0 release. The focus of the 1.0 release will be implementing
build automation to enforce API stability, and a very small number of
high value features. For more information see the `project roadmap`_.

Migration Guide
---------------

As the project approaches a 1.0 release, it is necessary to make some changes
to bring interfaces and functionality up to a point that can be maintained
long-term. We try to limit such changes as much as possible, and have a
period of deprecation.

Deprecations removed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All previous deprecations up to ``0.12.0`` have be removed. Below is the
complete list of removals.

Modules and functions and classes that have been removed:

============================ ========================== ===================================
Functions Removed            Modules Removed            Classes Removed
============================ ========================== ===================================
``bokeh.embed.components``   ``bokeh.browserlib``       ``bokeh.core.properties.TitleProp``
``bokeh.charts.hplot``       ``bokeh.mixins``           ``bokeh.models.layouts.GridPlot``
``bokeh.charts.vplot``       ``bokeh.plotting_helpers`` ``bokeh.models.layouts.VBoxForm``
``bokeh.io.hplot``           ``bokeh.properties``
``bokeh.io.hplot``           ``bokeh.templates``
``bokeh.io.vform``

============================ ========================== ===================================

The methods ``bokeh.document.add`` and ``push_notebook`` of
``ColumnDataSource`` have been removed.

Additionally, the property ``bokeh.charts.builder.Builder.sort_legend`` was
removed, as well as the following properties of ``Plot``

* ``border_fill``
* ``background_fill``
* ``logo``
* ``responsive``
* ``title_text_align``
* ``title_text_alpha``
* ``title_text_baseline``
* ``title_text_color``
* ``title_text_font``
* ``title_text_font_size``

``abstract`` moved
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``abstract`` class decorator was moved from ``models.py`` to
``has_props.py`` in order that ``models.py`` only contain classes that might
be of normal interest to users. The class decorator now also adds an
admonition to the docstring of any class marked abstract that it is not
useful to instantiate directly.
