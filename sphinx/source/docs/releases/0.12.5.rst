0.12.5 (XYZ 2017)
=================

Bokeh Version ``0.12.5`` is an incremental update that adds a few important
features and fixes several bugs. Some of the highlights include:


Many other small bugfixes and docs additions. For full details see the
:bokeh-tree:`CHANGELOG`.

NOTE: the 0.12.x series is the last planned release series before a
version 1.0 release. The focus of the 1.0 release will be implementing
build automation to enforce API stability, and a very small number of
high value features. For more information see the `project roadmap`_.

Migration Guide
---------------

As the project approaches a 1.0 release, it is necessary to make some changes
to bring interfaces and functionality up to a point that can be maintained
long-term. We try to limit such changes as much as possible, and have a
period of deprecation.

JQuery removed from BokehJS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

JQuery has been removed as a build dependency of BokehJS, resulting in a ~10%
reduction in the size of the minified code. The variable `Bokeh.$` is no
longer available. If you require JQuery (i.e. for a custom extension or when
using the JavaScript API) you will need to provide it explicitly.

underscore.js removed from BokehJS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

underscore.js has been removed as a build dependency of BokehJS. The variable
`Bokeh._` is no longer available. If you require underscore.js (i.e. for a custom
extension or when using the JavaScript API) you will need to provide it explicitly.
