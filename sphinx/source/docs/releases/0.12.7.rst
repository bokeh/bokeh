0.12.7
======

Bokeh Version ``0.12.7`` is an incremental update that adds a few important
features and fixes several bugs. Some of the highlights include:

New embed methods
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Two new embed methods were added: ``server_document`` and ``server_session``.
Those methods work similarly to ``autoload_server`` except for a few differences:
with ``server_document`` a new session will systematically be generated and
an entire document will be returned; with ``server_session`` an existing session
id and model must be provided. Another difference from ``autoload_server`` is
that with those two new methods one may choose to not load the JS/CSS resource
files by passing a ``resources="none"`` parameter.

New Deprecations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``bokeh.embed.autoload_server`` has been deprecated in place of
``bokeh.embed.server_document`` and ``bokeh.embed.server_session``.

``bokeh.models.tools.tool_events`` has been deprecated. Users should instead
use the ``SelectionGeometry`` Event present on ``Plot`` or ``Figure``.

bokeh-widgets' split
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`bokeh-widgets` bundle was split into `bokeh-widgets` and `bokeh-tables`. This
is to reduce the weight of the main widgets' bundle. bokeh includes `bokeh-tables`
automatically when necessary, so this change should be transparent for most users.
However, users of custom templates or some advanced embedding scenarios may be
affected.

TapTool Callback Calling Convention
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The TapTool strayed from usual callback calling convention by passing a glyph
data source as ``cb_obj``. This has been rectified, and now the tool follows the
usual convetion: the tool itself is passed as ``cb_obj`` and the data source is
passed as part of the optional ``cb_data``. Existing usage of ``OpenURL`` is
unaffected by this change, but any ``CustomJS`` callbacks used with the tap tool
will need to be updated to reflect this change.
