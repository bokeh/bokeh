0.12.7
======

Bokeh Version ``0.12.7`` is an incremental update that adds a few important
features and fixes several bugs. Some of the highlights include:

* Support graphs/trees/networks (:bokeh-issue:`187`) including configurable
  and extendable policies for highlighting and selection.
* Filterable/Sliceable CDS views (:bokeh-issue:`4070`)
* Pass HTTP request args to embedded sessions (:bokeh-issue:`5992`)
* New :class:`~bokeh.models.expressions.Expression` models for client-side
  computations, including :class:`~bokeh.models.expressions.Stack`, for
  stacking CDS columns.
* New module :ref:`bokeh.transform` with helper functions for simplifying
  ``DataSpec`` expressions, including  :func:`~bokeh.transform.jitter`,
  :func:`~bokeh.transform.dodge`, :func:`~bokeh.transform.factor_cmap`, etc.
* Added :func:`~bokeh.plotting.figure.Figure.hbar_stack` and
  :func:`~bokeh.plotting.figure.Figure.vbar_stack` to greatly simplify
  creation of stacked bar charts.
* Improvements for using Bokeh with Categorical data:

  - Support multi-level categories and hierarchical axes
  - Arbitrary limits on category names (e.g. no ``':'``) have been lifted
  - Optional Pandas integration creates CDS from directly from ``GroupBy``
    objects
  - Categorical Bar, Heatmap and Scatter plots easier to create with stable
    ``bokeh.plotting`` APIs
  - New User's Guide chapter :ref:`userguide_categorical`

 Many other small bugfixes and docs additions. For full details see the
 :bokeh-tree:`CHANGELOG`.

Migration Guide
---------------

NOTE: the 0.12.x series is the last planned release series before a
version 1.0 release. The focus of the 1.0 release will be implementing
build automation to enforce API stability, and a very small number of
high value features. For more information see the `project roadmap`_.

Breakage Related to Categoricals Overhaul
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Bokeh support for Categorical data has needed attention for some time.
The release brings improvements that *dramatically* improve the user
experience when using categorical data with Bokeh. For details and
examples, see the new User's Guide chapter :ref:`userguide_categorical`.

At this point we endeavor to minimize breakage, and to provide managed
deprecation cycles when things must change. However, in this instance,
some minor *immediate* breaking changes were unavoidable:

* ``min_interval`` and ``max_interval`` on ``FactorRange`` are now
  given in synthetic coordinate units.

* ``bounds`` on ``FactorRange`` are now given in synthetic coordinate
  units.

New Embed Functions for Bokeh Applications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Two new embed functions similar to ``autoload_server`` are added, that have
simpler APIs and are more focused:

* :func:`bokeh.embed.server_document` for embedding new sessions for entire
  Bokeh documents in HTML pages. (More common)

* :func:`bokeh.embed.server_session` for embedding existing sessions for
  specified Bokeh models in HTML pages (Less common)

Additionally, with these new methods one may choose to not load the JS/CSS
resource files by passing ``resources="none"`` as a parameter.

Deprecations Removed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following previously deprecated modules or features have been removed:

* ``bokeh.icons`` module

* Legacy anchor and legend locations ``left_center`` and ``right_center``

* ``ImageRGBA.rows`` and ``ImageRGBA.cols`` properties

* ``HBox`` and ``VBox`` in ``bokeh.layouts``

* ``validate`` keyword argument for ``bokeh.io.save``

New Deprecations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``bokeh.embed.autoload_server`` has been deprecated and replaced with the
two simpler functions :func:`~bokeh.embed.server_document` and
:func:`~bokeh.embed.server_session` described above.

``bokeh.models.tools.tool_events`` has been deprecated. Users should instead
use the ``SelectionGeometry`` event present on ``Plot`` or ``Figure``.

``DynamicImageRenderer`` and ``Plot.add_dyanamic_image`` have been deprecated.
For GIS-related use-cases built on top of Bokeh, consider using
GeoViews_, or creating a `Custom Extension`_.

``ResizeTool`` is deprecated and also *immediately* is a NO-OP on the Python
side. ``ResizeTool`` has been removed from BokehJS entirely.

BokehJS Widgets Bundle Split
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `bokeh-widgets` bundle was split into ``bokeh-widgets`` and
``bokeh-tables``. This is to reduce the weight of the main widgets' bundle.
Bokeh includes ``bokeh-tables`` automatically when necessary, so this change
should be transparent for most users. However, users of custom templates or
other advanced embedding scenarios may be affected.

TapTool Callback Calling Convention
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The TapTool strayed from usual callback calling convention by passing a glyph
data source as ``cb_obj``. This has been rectified, and now the tool follows the
usual convetion: the tool itself is passed as ``cb_obj`` and the data source is
passed as part of the optional ``cb_data``. Existing usage of ``OpenURL`` is
unaffected by this change, but any ``CustomJS`` callbacks used with the tap tool
will need to be updated to reflect this change.

DataTable Selection Highlighting Signal
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The DataTable now responds to the signal ``source.change.emit()``, instead of
``source.properties.selected.change.emit()``, to visually highlight the rows in the
DataTable that are part of the selection. If you have used
``source.properties.selected.change.emit()`` in CustomJS code, you will need to
change it to ``source.change.emit()``.

The DataTable responds automatically to changes in its data source's ``selected``
property. However, because of Bokeh's change detection machinery, only a replacement
of the ``selected`` property causes a change signal to be emitted, and not a partial update
(e.g. ``source.selected['1d']['indices'] = [1, 2]``). If you use a partial update in CustomJS
code, you will need to emit the change signal yourself:

.. code-block:: python

    customjs = CustomJS(args=dict(source=source), code="""
        source['selected']['1d'].indices = [1, 2]
        source.change.emit();
    """)
