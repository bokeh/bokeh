0.12.7
======

Bokeh Version ``0.12.7`` is an incremental update that adds a few important
features and fixes several bugs. Some of the highlights include:

Better Embed Functions for Applications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Two new embed functions similar to ``autoload_server`` are added, that have
simpler APIs and are more focused:

* :func:`bokeh.embed.server_document` for embedding new sessions for entire
  Bokeh documents in HTML pages. (More common)

* :func:`bokeh.embed.server_session` for embedding existing sessions for
  specified Bokeh models in HTML pages (Less common)

Additionally, with these new methods one may choose to not load the JS/CSS
resource files by passing ``resources="none"`` as a parameter.

Deprecations Removed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following previously deprecated modules or features have been removed:

* ``bokeh.icons`` module

* Legacy anchor and legend locations ``left_center`` and ``right_center``

* ``ImageRGBA.rows`` and ``ImageRGBA.cols`` properties

* ``HBox`` and ``VBox`` in ``bokeh.layouts``

* ``validate`` keyword argument for ``bokeh.io.save``

New Deprecations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``bokeh.embed.autoload_server`` has been deprecated and replaced with the
two simpler functions :func:`~bokeh.embed.server_document` and
:func:`~bokeh.embed.server_session` described above.

``bokeh.models.tools.tool_events`` has been deprecated. Users should instead
use the ``SelectionGeometry`` event present on ``Plot`` or ``Figure``.

``DynamicImageRenderer`` and ``Plot.add_dyanamic_image`` have been deprecated.
For GIS-related use-cases built on top of Bokeh, consider using
GeoViews_, or creating a `Custom Extension`_.

BokehJS Widgets Bundle Split
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `bokeh-widgets` bundle was split into ``bokeh-widgets`` and
``bokeh-tables``. This is to reduce the weight of the main widgets' bundle.
Bokeh includes ``bokeh-tables`` automatically when necessary, so this change
should be transparent for most users. However, users of custom templates or
other advanced embedding scenarios may be affected.

TapTool Callback Calling Convention
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The TapTool strayed from usual callback calling convention by passing a glyph
data source as ``cb_obj``. This has been rectified, and now the tool follows the
usual convetion: the tool itself is passed as ``cb_obj`` and the data source is
passed as part of the optional ``cb_data``. Existing usage of ``OpenURL`` is
unaffected by this change, but any ``CustomJS`` callbacks used with the tap tool
will need to be updated to reflect this change.
