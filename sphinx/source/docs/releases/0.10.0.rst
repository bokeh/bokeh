Migration Guide
---------------

This release introduced a new, often requested style of chart interface that
is centered around Pandas DataFrames.  All of "old style" charts in the
``bokeh.charts`` interface have been moved to ``bokeh._legacy_charts``,
which  will eventually be removed, when all charts have been updated.
To continue to use the old charts, replace``bokeh.charts`` with
``bokeh._legacy_charts``, e.g.:

.. code-block:: python

    from bokeh.charts import Area

becomes

.. code-block:: python

    from bokeh._legacy_charts import Area
