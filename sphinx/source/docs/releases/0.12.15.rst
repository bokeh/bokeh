==================

important features and fixes several bugs. Some of the highlights
include:



Many other small bugfixes and docs additions. For full details see the
:bokeh-tree:`CHANGELOG`.

Migration Guide
---------------

NOTE: the 0.12.x series is the last planned release series before a version
1.0 release. For more information see the `project roadmap`_.

Grid Bounds
~~~~~~~~~~~

Grids now automatically defer to any existing axis bounds when their
own bounds are set to `"auto"`. Previously grids used always used the full
range bounds. This change makes it simpler to have axes and grids both
use a consistent set of bounds.

Minor Ticks
~~~~~~~~~~~

Minor ticks are no longer displayed outside explicitly set axis bounds.
Previously minor ticks would display one extra "major tick" distance outside
explicit range bounds.

Sphinx Plot Extension
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `bokeh-plot` Sphinx extension previously assumed the location of scripts was relative
to a `source` subdirectory of the Sphinx project. This is no longer the case. Now, the full
relative path from the Sphinx project (i.e. from the `Makefile`) should be provided.
