`Migration Guide <releases.html#release-2-0-0-migration>`__
-----------------------------------------------------------

Minimum Python Version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Bokeh now requires Python 3.5 or higher.

Minimum Tornado Version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Bokeh server now requires Tornado 5.0 or higher.

Bokeh Sphinx Extension
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The obsolete Sphinx confiuguration parameters ``bokeh_plot_use_relative_paths``
and ``bokeh_plot_pyfile_include_dirs`` have been removed. The unused
``PLOT_PAGE`` template has also been removed.

"Use Strict" for CustomJS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``use_strict`` property has been removed from all models that it had been
on previously. All JavaScript code, e.g. for ``CustomJS`` will always be rendered
with ``"use_strict"`` added.

Tile Providers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The named tile properties in ``tile_providers.py``, e.g ``CARTODBPOSITRON`` now
return then vendor id for that tile provider. This is can be passed to the
``get_provider`` method directly to return a new ``TileProvider`` instance.

ColumnDataSource Properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``ColumnDataSource.selected`` property is now read-only.

The ``ColumnDataSource.data`` property can only be set from plain Python dicts.
Attempting to set from another CDS, i.e ``s1.data = s2.data``, will raise an
error.

Plot Symmetry Properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The deprecated vestigal properties ``Plot.h_symmetry`` and ``Plot.v_symmetry``
have been removed. These properties were non-functional for many releases.

bokeh.util.future module
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``bokeh.util.future`` module has been removed.

bokeh.util.string module
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `encode_utf8`, `decode_utf8`, and `escape` functions have been removed.
