Deprecations
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following features or APIs were deprecated in version 1.1 and will be
removed in a future 2.0 release:

* Support for CoffeeScript in ``CustomJS`` or custom extensions. Use JavaScript
  or Typescript instead.

* Support for ``ClientSession.loop_until_closed``. This function is intented
  to support testing only, and will be removed from the public API. Bokeh
  applications should be run directly on a Bokeh server.

* Support for "transpiling" Python code to JavaScript. All ``from_py_func``
  methods will be removed. Use JavaScript or Typescript instead.
