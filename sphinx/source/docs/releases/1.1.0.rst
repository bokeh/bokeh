Bokeh Version ``1.1.0`` (January 2019) primarily

Migration Guide
---------------

.. _release-1-1-0-new:

New in 1.1
~~~~~~~~~~

The ``js_link`` function was added to make it simpler to link two Bokeh model
properties together:

.. code:: python

    slider.js_link('value', r.glyph, 'radius')

See :ref:`userguide_interaction_linked_properties` for more information.

The ``Slider.value_as_date`` method was added to conveniently retrieve Slider
values as date objects when appropriate.

.. _release-1-1-0-deprecations:

Deprecations
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following features or APIs were deprecated in version 1.1 and will be
removed in a future 2.0 release:

* Support for CoffeeScript in ``CustomJS`` or custom extensions. Use JavaScript
  or Typescript instead.

* Support for ``ClientSession.loop_until_closed``. This function is intented
  to support testing only, and will be removed from the public API. Bokeh
  applications should be run directly on a Bokeh server.

* Support for "transpiling" Python code to JavaScript. All ``from_py_func``
  methods will be removed. Use JavaScript or Typescript instead.

Changes to bokeh.sphinxext
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to support a longer term goal of moving Bokeh docs to `ReadTheDocs`_,
some changes to the ``bokeh-plot`` Sphinx directive were necessary. These are:

* Plot script files are now always placed immediately adjacent to the document
  they are for, and loaded using relative URLs.

* The config values ``bokeh_plot_pyfile_include_dirs`` and
  ``bokeh_plot_use_relative_paths`` are no longer needed. Setting them will have
  no effect (but will not break existing builds). These config values will be
  removed in a future 2.0 release.

We believe that there are very few users of ``bokeh.sphinxext`` outside the
project itself, and that these changes will not cause any breakage for any of
those users. However, please reach out for support if any unforseen issues arise.
