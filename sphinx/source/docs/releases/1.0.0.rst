1.0.0 (August 2018)
===================

Bokeh Version ``1.0.0``

Some of the highlights include:


And several other bug fixes and docs additions. For full details see the
:bokeh-tree:`CHANGELOG`.

Migration Guide
---------------

New Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

"Pillow>=4.0" has been added to the list of Bokeh runtime dependencies.

Pretty printing functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``pprint`` and ``pretty`` methods depended on IPython pretty-printing
in order to function. Recent changes to IPython pretty-printing machinery
made it impossible to use unless the "pretty" repr was also enabled. This
caused ipython console to be spammed with very large amounts of output,
making it unusable. As a result, both ``pprint`` and ``pretty`` methods have
been removed. A "pretty" HTML repr still functions in Jupyter notebooks. This
change is not expected to affect any normal usage.

``bokeh.util.plot_utils``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``bokeh.util.plot_utils`` module has been removed. This module contained
only private functions used internally. This change is not expected to affect
any normal usage.

``bokeh.server.application_context``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``bokeh.server.application_context`` module has been renamed to
``bokeh.server.contexts``.  This change is not expected to affect any normal
usage.

``arguments`` parameter for ``server_session``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``server_session`` function accepted an ``arguments`` parameter that did not
(and could not) have any actual effect. It has been removed, immediately. Since
the parameter did not function, it is not expected that this change will affect
any normal usage.

Codebase Tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Pytest "quality" mark has been changed to "codebase". Now to run the
codebase tests, execute ``py.test -m codebase``. If you have installed a
pre-commit hook to run quality tests before allowing a commit, the hook code
should be updated as above. This change is only expected to affect those who
are developing the Bokeh codebase.
