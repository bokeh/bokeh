Migration Guide
---------------

Pretty printing functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``pprint`` and ``pretty`` methods depended on IPython pretty-printing
in order to function. Recent changes to IPython pretty-printing machinery
made it impossible to use unless the "pretty" repr was also enabled. This
caused ipython console to be spammed with very large amounts of output,
making it unusable. As a result, both ``pprint`` and ``pretty`` methods have
been removed. A "pretty" HTML repr still functions in Jupyter notebooks. This
change is not expected to affect any normal usage.

``bokeh.util.plot_utils``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``bokeh.util.plot_utils`` module has been removed. This module contained
only private functions used internally. This change is not expected to affect
any normal usage.

``bokeh.server.application_context``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``bokeh.server.application_context`` module has been renamed to
``bokeh.server.contexts``.  This change is not expected to affect any normal
usage.
