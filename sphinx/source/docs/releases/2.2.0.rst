`Migration Guide <releases.html#release-2-2-0-migration>`__
-----------------------------------------------------------

Oval glyph deprecated
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``Ovall`` glyph is largely duplicative of the ellipse glyph, and will be
removed in version 3.0. Use ``Ellipse`` instead.

``Tooltip.inner_only`` deprecated
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This property was non-functional an unnecessary and has been removed. No
replacement is provided.

``scenterx`` and ``scentery`` deprecated
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Previosuly, glyphs could implement separate ``scenterx`` and ``scentery`` to
report a "center" location that could anchor hovers. These have been combined in
to a single ``Glyph.scenterxy()`` method that should be implemented instead.
(This change is only relevant if you are implementing a new glyph in Bokeh or in
a custom extension.)
