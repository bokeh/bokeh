`Migration Guide`
-----------------

``auth_request_handler`` to improve ``AuthMixin`` hierarachy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``AuthMixin`` was not a proper Mixin as it shadowed methods on another base
class. Class ``AuthMixin`` is now replaced by ``BokehAuthRequestHandler``
which is a sub-class of ``RequestHandler`` and hence solves the problem of
multiple inheritance.
