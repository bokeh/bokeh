`Migration Guide`
-----------------

Removals
~~~~~~~~

``plot_width`` and ``plot_height``
..................................

These properties have been removed. Use standard ``width`` and ``height`` for
all layout-able models.

``AuthMixin``
.............

Class ``AuthMixin`` is replaced by ``AuthRequestHandler``, a sub-class of
``RequestHandler``.

``legend``
..........

The ``legend`` keyword argument to glyph methods has been removed. Use more
specific ``legend_label``, ``legend_group``, and ``legend_field`` instead.

``Oval``
........

The ``Oval``glyph is removed. Use ``Ellipse`` instead.

``GridSpec``
............

This model has been removed with no replacement.q

``names`` properties
....................

Some models could be configured with both a ``names`` property and a
``renderers`` property. In all cases, ``names`` has been removed. Use the
``renderers`` property to specify renderers.

``WidgetBox``
.............

The ``WidgetBox`` model and associated convenience function ``widgetbox`` have
been removed. Use row, column, and grid layouts instead.

Markers
.......

Individual scatter markers, e.g ``Square``, ``DiamondX`` have been removed,
along with their related glyph methods. Use ``Scatter`` and ``Figure.scatter``
instead.

``bokeh.util.session_id``
.........................

This module has been removed. Use ``bokeh.util.token`` instead.

``WebSource``
.............

This model has been removed, use ``WebDataSource`` instead.

``from_networkx``
.................

The ``from_networkx`` function is now only available to import from
``bokeh.plotting``.

Distance Specs
..............

``ScreenDistanceSpec`` and ``DataDistanceSpec`` are removed. Use ``SizeSpec``
instead.

``EditTool.custom_icon`` was replaced with ``Tool.icon``
........................................................

Use ``Tool.icon`` property instead.

``render_mode``
...............

``render_mode`` was removed from all annotations. Annotations were cleanly
separated between those which render to canvas and those that use HTML and CSS.
The default is canvas rendering. Use the new ``HTMLTitle``, ``HTMLLabel`` and
``HTMLLabelSet`` models whenever previously ``css`` render mode was used. Note
that ``Span`` and ``BoxAnnotation`` don't have a HTML equivalent anymore.

``HasProps.__subtype__``
........................

Explicit sub-typing support was removed both from models and the protocol.
If you want to extend existing models without the need for providing an
implementation, then use data models (e.g. extend from ``DataModel``).
