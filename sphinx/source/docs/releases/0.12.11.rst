1.0 release. For more information see the `project roadmap`_.

Breaking changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Shorthand initialization syntax for `Range1d(start, end)` in bokehjs was
removed due to technical difficulties. Use full `new Range1d({start, end})`
syntax instead. The short syntax may be restored at some point as a part of
`bokeh-api` package.
