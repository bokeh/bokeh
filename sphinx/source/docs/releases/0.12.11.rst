Migration Guide
---------------

NOTE: the 0.12.x series is the last planned release series before a version
1.0 release. For more information see the `project roadmap`_.

Breaking changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Shorthand initialization syntax for `Range1d(start, end)` in bokehjs was
removed due to technical difficulties. Use full `new Range1d({start, end})`
syntax instead. The short syntax may be restored at some point as a part of
`bokeh-api` package.

The coordinate system of canvas layout and related infrastructure (positioning,
hit testing, etc.) is new "screen", where the origin is left-top corner of the
canvas. This change shouldn't affect users, however it affects custom model
developers. Follow updated examples for new development patterns.
