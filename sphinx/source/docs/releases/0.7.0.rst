0.7.0 (Dec 2014)
================

This release focused on new features and capability, particularly around
user interface and experience:

* IPython widgets and animations without a Bokeh server
* Touch UI working for tools on mobile devices
* Vastly improved linked data table
* More new (and improving) bokeh.charts (high level charting interface)
* Color mappers on the python side
* Improved toolbar
* Many new tools: lasso, poly, and point selection, crosshair inspector

Deprecations
------------

Additionally, note that the "implicit" plotting interface of plotting.py
has been deprecated, and will be removed in Bokeh 0.8. In a nutshell,
code such as::

    figure()
    hold()
    line()
    circle()
    show()

Should be replaced with the more explicit code::

    p = figure()
    p.line()
    p.circle()
    show(p)
