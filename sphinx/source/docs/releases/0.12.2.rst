`Migration Guide <releases.html#release-0-12-2-migration>`__
------------------------------------------------------------

Jupyter Notebook output changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As part of the changes to ensure that the BokehJS client library has loaded
before attempting to render plots in the notebook, a new ``notebook_handle``
argument was added to the ``bokeh.io.show`` method. When set to ``True`` (with
``output_notebook`` enabled), the ``show`` method will return a handle that
can be used with ``push_notebook``.

For users who rely on the notebook handles to update plots out of their render
order, you'll have to add ``notebook_handle=True`` to your ``show`` invocations
like below:

.. code-block:: python

    from bokeh.plotting import figure
    from bokeh.io import output_notebook, push_notebook, show
    output_notebook()
    plot = figure()
    plot.circle([1,2,3], [4,6,5])
    handle = show(plot, notebook_handle=True)
    # Update the plot title in the earlier cell
    plot.title = "New Title"
    push_notebook(handle=handle)

BokehJS API Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to shrink the size of the main BokehJS library and reduce pageload
times, the Bokeh JS API has been separated into it's own bokeh-api(.min).js
bundle. For users requiring the JS API, it will be necessary to add the new
resource to their HTML templates.
