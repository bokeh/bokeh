Bokeh is an open source project and we love having new contributors. Hopefully,
you will find all the information you need in the following pages, linked below
and in the sidebar to the left. If not, please `contact the developers`_ with
any questions.

The software development process for Bokeh is outlined in
`Bokeh Enhancement Proposal 1`_. All changes, enhancements,
and bugfixes should generally go through the process outlined there.

The process for creating, distributing, and announcing final releases
of Bokeh is outlined in `Bokeh Enhancement Proposal 2`_.
