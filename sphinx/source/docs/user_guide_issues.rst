Reporting Issues
================

You can report possible bugs, start discussions, or ask for features on our
`issue tracker <https://github.com/ContinuumIO/bokeh/issues>`_.
To start a new issue, you will find a ``New issue`` green button at the top
right area of the page.

Bokeh also provides the :func:`bokeh.report_issue()` function to easily open
issues from an interactive console prompt::


    In [1]: bokeh.report_issue()
    This is the Bokeh reporting engine.

    You will be guided to build a GitHub issue.

This will open a new issue on our issue tracker as well as open a new browser tab
showing the issue, in case you want to add more comments. As you can see, this
automatically appends useful information about versions and architecture that can
help us to reproduce the problem.

Finally, you can also make a comment on any issue using this tool just by passing
the issue number as an argument::

    In [3]: bokeh.report_issue(555)
