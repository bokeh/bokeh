[TBD] Creating a successful Pull Request
========================================

TBD: Infos on PR management in the Bokeh repository (branches, releases,
review process, etc)

[TBD] include tests: In order to help keep Bokeh maintainable, all Pull Requests that add or
update code should include added or updated tests. .....
should normally be accompanied by relevant tests. While exceptions may be
made for specific circumstances, the default assumption should be that a
Pull Request without tests may not be merged.
