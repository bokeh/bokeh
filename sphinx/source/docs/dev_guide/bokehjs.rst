BokehJS
=======

BokehJS is the in-browser client-side runtime library that users of Bokeh
ultimately interact with. This library is written primarily in TypeScript
and is one of the unique things about the Bokeh plotting system.

BokehJS Motivations
-------------------

When researching the wide field of JavaScript plotting libraries, we found
that they were all architected and designed to integrate with other JavaScript.
If they provided any server-side wrappers, those were always "second class"
and primarily designed to generate a simple configuration for the front-end JS.
Of the few JS plotting libraries that offered any level of interactivity, the
interaction was not really configurable or customizable from outside the JS
itself. Very few JS plotting libraries took large and streaming server-side
data into account, and providing seamless access to those facilities from
another language like Python was not a consideration.

This, in turn, has caused the developers of Python plotting libraries to
only treat the browser as a "backend target" environment, for which they
will generate static images or a bunch of JavaScript.

.. _devguide_bokehjs_goals:

Goals
-----

BokehJS is intended to be a standalone, first-class JavaScript plotting
library and *interaction runtime* for dynamic, highly-customizable
information visualization.

.. _devguide_bokehjs_interface:

Interface
---------

BokehJS is a standalone JavaScript library for dynamic and interactive
visualization in the browser. It is built on top of HTML5 canvas, and designed
for high-performance rendering of larger data sets. Its interface is declarative,
in the style of Protovis_, but its implementation consists of a reactive scene
graph (similar to Chaco_).

More information is available at :ref:`userguide_bokehjs`.

CSS Class Names
---------------

The CSS for controlling Bokeh presentation are located in a ``bokeh.css`` file
that is compiled from several separate ``.less`` files in the BokehJS source
tree. All CSS classes specifically for Bokeh DOM elements are prefixed with
the string ``bk-``. For instance some examples are: ``.bk-plot``, ``.bk-toolbar-button``, etc.

.. _devguide_bokehjs_development:

Development
-----------

BokehJS's source code is located in the ``bokehjs/`` directory in Bokeh's monorepo
repository. All further instructions and shell commands assume that ``bokehjs/``
is the current directory.

Some guidelines to adhere to when working on BokehJS:

* Do not use ``for-in`` loops, especially unguarded by ``hasOwnProperty()`` Use
  ``for-of`` loop in combination with ``keys()``, ``values()`` and/or
  ``entries()`` from the ``core/util/object`` module instead.

Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* node 12.*
* npm 6.14+ (most recent version)
* chromium browser 80+ or equivalent

You can install nodejs with conda:

.. code-block:: sh

    $ conda install -c conda-forge nodejs

or follow the official installation `instructions <https://nodejs.org/en/download/>`_.

Upgrade your npm after installing or updating nodejs, or whenever asked by npm:

.. code-block:: sh

    $ npm install -g npm

Officially supported platforms are as follows:

* Linux Ubuntu 18.04+ or equivalent
* Windows 10 (or Server 2019)
* MacOS 10.15

BokehJS can be developed on different platforms and versions of aforementioned
software, but results may vary, especially when it comes to testing (visual
testing in particular).

Building
~~~~~~~~

BokehJS's build is maintained by using an in-house tool that visually resembles
gulp. All commands start with ``node make`` (don't confuse this with GNU make).

Most common commands:

* ``node make build``
* ``node make test``
* ``node make lint``

Use ``node make help`` to list all available commands.

``node make`` automatically runs ``npm install`` whenever ``package.json`` changes.

You can use ``tsc`` directly for error checking (e.g. in an IDE). However, don't use
it for code emit, because we rely on AST transforms to produce viable library code.

Testing
~~~~~~~

BokehJS testing is performed with the ``node make test`` command. You can run individual
test suites with ``node make test:suite_name``. Known tests suites are:

* ``node make test:codebase``
* ``node make test:defaults``
* ``node make test:unit``
* ``node make test:integration``

The last two can be run with ``node make test:lib``. Unit and integration tests are
run in a web browser (see requirements), which is started automatically with the
right settings to guarantee consistent test results.

To review the visual tests' output, start BokehJS's devtools server:

.. code-block:: sh

    $ node test/devtools server
    listening on 127.0.0.1:5777

and navigate to ``/integration/report``. Devtools server can also be used to
manually inspect and debug tests. For that, the following endpoints are available:

* ``/unit``
* ``/defaults``
* ``/integration``

Those load BokehJS and the tests, but don't do anything. You have to issue ``Tests.run_all()``
in a JavaScript console. This allows you to set breakpoints before running code. You
can filter out tests by providing a string keyword or a regular expression. Alternatively,
you can run tests immediately with these endpoints:

* ``/unit/run``
* ``/defaults/run``
* ``/integration/run``

You can use ``?k=some%20text`` to filter tests by a keyword.

CI and Visual Testing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``test:integration`` does two types of tests:

* textual baseline tests
* visual/screenshot tests

Textual baselines are cross-platform compatible and can be generated locally (on
supported platforms) or in CI. Visual testing is platform depended and fairly
sensitive to system configuration (especially in regard to differences in font
rendering). Visual tests can be performed locally, but given that baseline images
for all three supported platforms have to be updated, the preferred approach is
to generate images and compare them in CI.

The full procedure for visual testing is as follows:

1. Make changes to the repository and write new tests or update existing.
2. Use ``node make tests`` to incrementally test your changes on your system.
3. Commit changes to textual baselines (``test/baselines/*``).
4. Push your changes to GitHub and wait for CI to finish.
5. If you added new tests, CI will expectedly fail with "missing baseline
   images" error message.
6. If tests passed then you are done.
7. If tests failed, go to BokehJS's GitHub_Actions_ page. Find the most recent
   test run for your PR and download the associated ``bokehjs-report`` artifact.
8. Unzip the artifact archive.
9. Assuming devtools server is running in the background, go to ``/integration/report?platform=name``
   where ``name`` is either ``linux``, ``macos`` or ``windows`` and review the test output
   for each platform. If there are no unintentional differences, then commit all
   new or modified files under ``test/baselines/{linux,macos,windows}``.
10. Push your changes again to GitHub and verify that tests pass this time.

.. note::

    Make sure to monitor the state of the ``test/baselines`` directory, so that you
    don't commit unnecessary files. If you do so, subsequent tests will fail.

Minimal Model/View Module
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Models (and views) come in many forms and sizes. At minimum, a model is implemented.
A view may follow if a "visual" model is being implemented. A minimal model/view
module looks like this:

.. code-block:: typescript

    import {BaseModel, BaseModelView} from "models/..."

    export class SomeModelView extends BaseModelView {
      model: SomeModel

      initialize(): void {
        super.initialize()
        // perform view initialization (remove if not needed)
      }

      async lazy_initialize(): Promise<void> {
        await super.lazy_initialize()
        // perform view lazy initialization (remove if not needed)
      }
    }

    export namespace SomeModel {
      export type Attrs = p.AttrsOf<Props>

      export type Props = BaseModel.Props & {
        some_property: p.Property<number>
        // add more property declarations
      }
    }

    export interface SomeModel extends SomeModel.Attrs {}

    export class SomeModel extends BaseModel {
      properties: SomeModel.Props
      __view_type__: SomeModelView

      // do not remove this constructor, or you won't be
      // able to use `new SomeModel({some_property: 1})`
      constructor(attrs?: Partial<SomeModel.Attrs>) {
        super(attrs)
      }

      static init_SomeModel(): void {
        this.prototype.default_view = SomeModelView

        this.define<SomeModel.Props>(({Number}) => ({
          some_property: [ Number, 0 ],
          // add more property definitions
        }))
      }
    }

For trivial modules like this, most of the code is just boilerplate to make
BokehJS's code statically type-check and generate useful type declarations
for further consumption (in tests or by users).

Code Style Guide
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

BokehJS doesn't have an explicit style guide. Make your changes consistent in
formatting. Use ``node make lint``. Follow patterns observed in the surrounding
code and apply common sense.
