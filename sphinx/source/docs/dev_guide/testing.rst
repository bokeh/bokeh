.. _contributor_guide_testing:

Running tests
=============

Bokeh is a large, multi-language project and relies on complex and
comprehensive tests and testing tools to help ensure consistency and
prevent regressions.

This chapter describes how to run various tests in a
:ref:`local development environment <contributor_guide_testing_local>` and in
:ref:`Bokeh's continuous integration (CI) system on GitHub
<contributor_guide_testing_ci>`.

.. _contributor_guide_testing_local:

Local testing
-------------

Almost all of Bokeh's tests can be run locally. However, some of the tests can
be complex to set up and run correctly on a local system. Therefore, all tests
will run in :ref:`Bokeh's CI <contributor_guide_testing_ci>` when you
:ref:`create a Pull Request <contributor_guide_pull_requests>` on Bokeh's GitHub
repository. **You don't need to set up and run all tests locally**.

Follow those general guidelines to decide which tests to run locally:

Whenever you change anything in Bokeh's codebase
    Run Bokeh's :ref:`codebase tests <contributor_guide_testing_local_codebase>`

When you edit Bokeh's Python code
    Run Bokeh's :ref:`Python unit tests
    <contributor_guide_testing_local_python_unit>`

When your work involves UI elements
    Run Bokeh's :ref:`Python integration tests
    <contributor_guide_testing_local_python_unit>`

When your change anything related to BokehJS
    Run Bokeh's :ref:`JavaScript tests
    <contributor_guide_testing_local_javascript_all>`

For reference, this section provides an overview of all available tests and how
to run them locally on most systems. Generally, it makes the most sense to
**only run specific tests related to what you are working on**. See
:ref:`Select specific tests <contributor_guide_testing_local_python_select>` for
instructions on how to select and deselect specific Python tests. See
:ref:`Select specific BokehJS tests
<contributor_guide_testing_local_javascript_selecting>` for instructions on how
to select and deselect specific :term:`BokehJS` tests.

Check basic requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before attempting to run Bokeh tests locally, make sure you have successfully
completed all of the steps in the :ref:`contributor_guide_setup` section of this
contributor guide.

Check that :ref:`Bokeh's sampledata <install_sampledata>` is installed and up to
date by running ``bokeh sampledata``. In case you are not able to install the
sampledata on your system, you have the option to
:ref:`disable those specific tests <contributor_guide_testing_local_python_select>`.

Several tests also require `Selenium`_ and a corresponding `web driver`_ to be
available on your system. While it is possible to use other web drivers for some
tests, the recommended setup is to use Selenium with `ChromeDriver`_ and
`Chrome`_. See :ref:`userguide_export_dependencies` for
installation instructions and more information. In case Selenium is not
available on your system, you have the option to
:ref:`disable those specific tests <contributor_guide_testing_local_python_select>`.

On some Unix platforms, you may also need to increase the "maximum
number of open file descriptors". Some tests open many files when testing the
server, so this number should be at least 1024.

.. code-block:: sh

    ulimit -n 1024

.. _contributor_guide_testing_local_codebase:

Run codebase tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The most basic set of tests are Bokeh's codebase tests. This includes
checking Python code with `flake8`_, checking JavaScript code with `ESLint`_,
and various other tests for issues such as unused imports and extra white
spaces.

Any edits you make to Bokeh's Python or JavaScript codebase should pass this
test.

Run this command from the top level of the repository:

.. code-block:: sh

    pytest tests/codebase

.. _contributor_guide_testing_local_python:

Run Python tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Bokeh includes a number of tests that are focused on Bokeh's Python code.
These tests use `pytest`_ and are located in the :bokeh-tree:`tests` folder.

Whenever you work with Bokeh's Python code, you should run Bokeh's
:ref:`codebase <contributor_guide_testing_local_codebase>` and
:ref:`Python unit tests <contributor_guide_testing_local_python_unit>`. In case
your work also included changes to user interface elements, you should also run
Bokeh's :ref:`Python integration tests
<contributor_guide_testing_local_python_integration>`.

These are some command-line arguments for ``pytest`` that are helpful to know
when working with Bokeh's pytest-based tests:

* ``-k``: Provide a search string to filter for specific tests. See
  :ref:`Select specific tests <contributor_guide_testing_local_python_select>`.
* ``-m``: Select or deselect specific tests based on markers. See
  :ref:`Select specific tests <contributor_guide_testing_local_python_select>`.
* ``-n``: Distribute testing over several CPUs or cores. Provide a number to
  define the number of cores to use. Set to ``auto`` to use all available cores.
  For example: ``pytest -n 4 tests/codebase``. See `pytest-xdist`_.
* ``-v``: Run test with more verbose output.
* ``--driver``: Use a specific web driver for Selenium-based tests
  (``"chrome"``, ``"firefox"``, or ``"safari"``). For example:
  ``pytest --driver="firefox" tests/integration/``.
* ``--no-js``: Skip any JavaScript code and only test Python code.

See the `pytest documentation`_ for more options.

.. _contributor_guide_testing_local_python_unit:

Unit tests
    To run Bokeh's Python unit tests, use the following command at the top
    level of the repository:

    .. code-block:: sh

        pytest -m "not selenium" tests/unit

    .. note::
        This command will exclude unit tests that require `Selenium`_. Because
        Selenium can be difficult to set up and because some unit tests require
        both `geckodriver`_ and `ChromeDriver`_ to be available on your system,
        using ``-m "not selenium"`` is the recommended way to run unit tests
        locally. Once you :ref:`create a Pull Request
        <contributor_guide_pull_requests>`, :ref:`Bokeh's CI
        <contributor_guide_testing_ci>` will run all tests, including
        Selenium-based unit tests. In case Selenium with both geckodriver and
        ChromeDriver is available on your system, you can run all unit tests
        with ``pytest tests/unit``.

.. _contributor_guide_testing_local_python_coverage:

Code coverage (Python unit tests)
    To create a coverage report for Python unit tests, use ``pytest`` with the
    command-line options ``--cov=bokeh`` and ``--cov-config=tests/.coveragerc``:

    .. code-block:: sh

        pytest --cov=bokeh --cov-config=tests/.coveragerc

    Coverage with Bokeh's Python unit tests should be around 90%. Coverage
    reports are only relevant for Python unit tests. There are no coverage
    reports for other Python tests or for any of the JavaScript code of BokehJS.

    You also have the option to add
    ``--cov=bokeh --cov-config=tests/.coveragerc`` when running a specific
    subset of Python unit tests. This adds a coverage report to the test
    results. For example:

    .. code-block:: sh

        pytest --cov=bokeh --cov-config=tests/.coveragerc -m "not selenium" tests/unit/bokeh/test_objects.py

    .. seealso::
        Coverage reports use the pytest plugin `pytest-cov`_. For more
        information, see the `documentation for pytest-cov`_.

.. _contributor_guide_testing_local_python_integration:

Integration tests
    To run Bokeh's Python-focused integration tests, use this command from the
    top level of the repository:

    .. code-block:: sh

        pytest tests/integration

    These tests mostly simulate UI interactions. Therefore, they require
    `Chrome`_ or `Chromium`_ and `Selenium`_ with the `ChromeDriver`_ web
    driver.

Run all available tests
    You can run all available tests (Python and JavaScript unit tests, examples,
    and integration tests) by running the following command from the top-level
    directory:

    .. code-block:: sh

        pytest

.. _contributor_guide_testing_local_python_select:

Select specific tests
    To test a subset of the Bokeh package, pass a path to ``pytest``:

    .. code-block:: sh

        pytest tests/unit/bokeh/models/

    Similarly, you can run a specific test by passing a specific file to
    ``pytest``:

    .. code-block:: sh

        pytest tests/unit/bokeh/models/test_grids.py

    Another way to select or deselect specific tests is to use markers.
    Currently, Bokeh's tests use the following two markers:

    * ``sampledata``: a test that requires ``bokeh.sampledata`` to be downloaded
    * ``selenium``: a test that requires selenium

    For more information on setting your own markers, see
    `Working with custom markers`_ in the `pytest documentation`_. To learn more
    about pytest's various options to select specific tests, see
    `Specifying which tests to run`_.

    For information on adding and updating Python tests, see
    :ref:`contributor_guide_writing_tests_python`.

.. _contributor_guide_testing_local_javascript:

Run JavaScript tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Most of the JavaScript-based tests for :term:`BokehJS` use a custom-made testing
framework. This framework **requires Google Chrome or Chromium**. You need a
recent version of one of these browsers available on your system to run those
tests locally.

.. _contributor_guide_testing_local_javascript_all:

Run all BokehJS tests
'''''''''''''''''''''

You can use ``pytest`` to run all available tests for BokehJS:

.. code-block:: sh

    pytest tests/test_bokehjs.py

This is a shortcut to run all BokehJS tests. You can run the same set of tests
directly with ``node make``, from the `bokehjs` subdirectory
of the source checkout:

.. code-block:: sh

    node make test

This runs a combination of codebase, defaults, unit, and integration test
suites.

.. _contributor_guide_testing_local_javascript_selecting:

Select specific BokehJS tests
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

You also have the option to run these test suites individually, using
``node make test:suite_name`` in the `bokehjs` subdirectory of the source
checkout:

* ``node make test:codebase``: Codebase tests checking file size limits
* ``node make test:defaults``: Tests checking whether the defaults in Bokeh’s
  Python models match those of Bokeh’s JavaScript models
* ``node make test:unit``: Unit tests for BokehJS
* ``node make test:integration``: Visual integration tests comparing locally
  generated plots against a set of baseline files

You can combine the last two test suites by running ``node make test:lib``.

Additionally, you can use search strings to select individual tests or groups
of tests. Use the ``-k`` argument to supply your search string. The search
string is case-sensitive. The BokehJS testing framework tries to match your
search string to the strings defined in the tests' ``describe()`` and
``it()`` functions. For example:

.. code-block:: sh

    $ node make test:integration -k "Legend"

This will only run integration tests that contain the string "Legend".

.. note::
    BokehJS Unit and integration tests require a recent version of Chrome or
    Chromium. The BokehJS testing framework starts the browser automatically
    with the right settings to produce consistent test results.

.. _contributor_guide_testing_local_javascript_devtools:

Testing with devtools server
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

In addition to running BokehJS tests from the command-line, you can also use
the BokehJS devtools server. This system requires the Chrome web browser to be
available on your system. Use the BokehJS devtools server to run tests and
review the visual tests' output.

First, start the devtools server from the `bokehjs` subdirectory with the
following command:

.. code-block:: sh

    $ node test/devtools server
    listening on 127.0.0.1:5777

You can now use the devtools server for the following operations:

Inspecting visual test results
    After running integration tests, you can use the devtools server to
    compare your local results with the baseline images. Open the displayed
    server URL (usually ``127.0.0.1:5777``) in the Chrome web browser and append
    ``/integration/report``. This will open a comparison view of any tests where
    your locally rendered plot is different from the baseline file. For example:

    .. image:: /_images/bokehjs_devtools_report.png
        :class: image-border
        :alt: Screenshot of devtool displaying a locally rendered image, an
            image diff and a baseline image.

Initiate test runs
    You can also use the devtools server to initiate test runs. You have two
    options:

    * Run tests from a JavaScript console
        Open one of these three endpoints in your web browser:

        * ``/unit``
        * ``/defaults``
        * ``/integration``

        This loads BokehJS and the tests. To run the tests, issue
        ``Tests.run_all()`` in Chrome's JavaScript console. This allows
        you to set breakpoints before running code. You can also pass a
        search string, list of strings, or regular expression as the function's
        ``query`` parameter to only run specific tests. For example:

        .. code-block:: TypeScript

            Tests.run_all(query=/[Ll]egend/);

    * Use endpoint to run tests
        Initiate test runs by accessing one of the following endpoints with your
        browser:

        * ``/unit/run``
        * ``/defaults/run``
        * ``/integration/run``

        .. image:: /_images/bokehjs_devtools_test_run.png
            :class: image-border
            :alt: Screenshot of devtool displaying various plots as a result of
                running integration tests.

To only run or view specific tests, append ``?k=some%20text`` to the URL. This
will filter tests by keyword.

To only run or view tests for a specific platform, append either
``platform=linux``, ``platform=macos``, or ``platform=windows`` to the URL.

    :ref:`contributor_guide_writing_tests_bokehjs`.

.. _contributor_guide_testing_local_examples:

Run examples tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In addition to Bokeh's Python- and JavaScript-focused tests, Bokeh uses a suite
of examples tests. This suite runs a selection of the examples in the Bokeh
repository to check whether each of the examples builds without generating
errors. Running these tests also generates a report with screenshots of those
plots.

The examples tests use a specialized testing framework, including a custom
configuration of Chrome. Therefore, it is **recommended not to run those
tests locally**. Instead, :ref:`Bokeh's CI <contributor_guide_testing_ci>` runs
all examples tests once you :ref:`create a Pull Request
<contributor_guide_pull_requests>`.

To run the examples tests locally, you first need to start a customized headless
version of Chrome in the background. This headless browser needs to be
started from the ``bokehjs`` folder. Use the following commands from the top
level of your *source checkout* directory:

.. code-block:: sh

    cd bokehjs
    node make test:run:headless

This starts a headless Chrome tool. Next, open a second terminal and run the
tests from the top level of your *source checkout* directory:

.. code-block:: sh

    pytest tests/test_examples.py

When running the tests, pytest also generates a report with screenshots of the
visual output of each of the examples. These screenshots are available in
``examples-report.html``. This file is located in the same directory that you
ran the tests from:

.. image:: /_images/examples_test_report.png
    :class: image-border
    :alt: Screenshot of a browser window displaying an examples test report
        consisting of various plots.

.. note::
    The examples tests don't analyze the generated screenshots and therefore
    won't fail based on the visual output. You need to inspect the test report
    manually.

In addition, the examples tests generate a log file called ``examples.log``
in the same directory.

.. _contributor_guide_testing_ci:

Continuous Integration (CI)
---------------------------

Every time you start a :ref:`Pull Request <contributor_guide_pull_requests>` or
add new commits to an existing Pull Request branch on Bokeh's GitHub repository,
`Bokeh's Continuous Integration (CI) <GithubCI_>`_ will run all available tests
on your branch.

You can see the list of all current and previous CI runs at this URL:
https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/actions

.. _contributor_guide_testing_ci_environments:

Environment files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Bokeh's CI runs tests on Linux, macOS, and Windows. It also runs tests with
different versions of Python. The various testing environments are defined
in their respective YAML files in the :bokeh-tree:`ci` folder. In case you add
or change dependencies, you need to update these files, in addition to
:bokeh-tree:`environment.yml` in the *source checkout* directory.

Etiquette
~~~~~~~~~

CI services provide finite free build workers to Open Source projects. Please
group your commits into meaningful chunks of work before pushing to GitHub
instead of pushing every commit individually. This will help you be considerate
of others who require access to these limited resources.
