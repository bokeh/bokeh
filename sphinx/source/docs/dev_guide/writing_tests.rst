.. _contributor_guide_writing_tests:

Writing tests
=============

To help keep Bokeh maintainable, all
:ref:`Pull Requests <contributor_guide_pull_requests>` that add or update code
should include new or updated tests. While exceptions are possible, a Pull
Request without adequate tests will generally not be considered ready to merge.

Follow those general guidelines to decide which kinds of tests to update or add:

When you edit Bokeh's Python code
    Check whether you should update or add
    :ref:`Python tests <contributor_guide_writing_tests_python>`

When your change anything related to BokehJS
    Check whether you should update or add
    :ref:`JavaScript tests <contributor_guide_writing_tests_bokehjs>`

When you fix a bug from Bokeh's issue tracker:
    Check whether you should add a
    :ref:`regression test <contributor_guide_writing_tests_bokehjs_regression>`

Before writing any tests, you should make sure to go through the relevant
passages in :ref:`contributor_guide_testing`. This chapter on writing tests
assumes you know how to run the tests you are working on.

.. _contributor_guide_writing_tests_python:

Writing Python tests
--------------------

If all or parts of your changes affect Bokeh's Python code, you should add or
update the relevant unit and integration tests.

These tests are located in the :bokeh-tree:`tests` folder. See
:ref:`contributor_guide_testing_local_python` for information on how to run
them.

General information on contributing to Bokeh's Python code and models is
available in :ref:`contributor_guide_models`.

.. _contributor_guide_writing_tests_python_unit:

Python unit tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Python unit tests help maintain the basic functionality of the Python portion of
Bokeh. They are located in :bokeh-tree:`tests/unit/bokeh`. The folder structure
resembles the structure of :ref:`Bokeh's Python models <refguide>`. The name of
each test file begins with ``test_``, followed by the module's name.

Follow these general guidelines when writing Python unit tests:

Import the model under test with ``as``
    Always import the specific model you are testing using the ``import as``
    syntax. Use the model's initials to name your import. For example:

    .. code-block:: Python

        import bokeh.plotting.graph as bpg

Use absolute imports
    Bokeh's unit tests should be as relocatable and unambiguous as possible.
    Therefore, you should use absolute imports (``from bokeh.embed import
    components``) in test files whenever possible. Don't use relative imports
    (``from ..document import Document``).

Use ``pytest`` (not ``unittest``)
    All new tests should use and assume `pytest`_ for all testing-related
    aspects, such as test running, fixtures, or parameterized testing. Please
    do *not* use the ``unittest`` module of the Python standard library.

.. _contributor_guide_writing_tests_integration:

Python integration tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Bokeh's Python-focused integration tests help make sure that Bokeh's Python code
works as intended with the TypeScript code of :term:`BokehJS`.

The Python integration tests use `Selenium`_ with `ChromeDriver`_. The test
scripts are located in :bokeh-tree:`tests/integration`. The folder structure
resembles the structure of Bokeh's Python models.

Python integration tests use pytest fixtures to handle the web driver
configuration and interaction with Selenium. Depending on which context you
want to test an object in, choose from ``bokeh_model_page``,
``single_plot_page``, or ``bokeh_server_page``. See
:bokeh-tree:`bokeh/_testing/plugins/project.py` for more details.

Follow these guidelines when adding or updating Python integration tests:

Keep your code as simple as possible
    Try to only include things that are essential to your test. Focus your test
    on one specific functionality. If possible, write several small tests
    instead of one complex one.

Use the |bokeh.models| API whenever possible
    Try to use Bokeh's
    :ref:`low-level bokeh.models interface <userguide_interfaces_models>`
    instead of the more high-level
    :ref:`bokeh.plotting interface <userguide_interfaces_plotting>`.

.. _contributor_guide_writing_tests_bokehjs:

Writing JavaScript tests (BokehJS)
----------------------------------

To maintain the functionality of all :term:`BokehJS` components, Bokeh includes
various tests written in TypeScript. If all or parts of your changes affect
the JavaScript code of BokehJS, you should add or update the relevant BokehJS
tests.

Bokeh's JavaScript tests use a custom testing framework that **requires Google
Chrome or Chromium**. You need a recent version of one of these browsers
available on your system to work with these tests.

Like several other testing frameworks such as `Mocha`_ or `Jasmine`_, the
BokehJS testing framework uses ``describe()`` and ``it()`` functions to set up
tests. Assertions are made with ``expect()`` and ``assert()``. Use ``assert()``
when you need to narrow types.

The BokehJS tests are located in :bokeh-tree:`bokehjs/test`. See
:ref:`contributor_guide_testing_local_javascript` for information on how to run
them.

General information on contributing to BokehJS is available in
:ref:`contributor_guide_bokehjs`.

.. _contributor_guide_writing_tests_bokehjs_unit:

BokehJS unit tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :term:`BokehJS` unit tests help make sure that the individual sections of
BokehJS function as expected. The unit tests for BokehJS are located in the
:bokeh-tree:`bokehjs/test/unit/` folder and sub-folders.

The basic structure for writing tests for Bokeh's testing framework is in parts
inspired by the `Chai "expect" assertion style <Chai_>`_. See the `API
documentation of the Chai Assertion Library <Chai documentation_>`_ for some
general ideas.

Use ``expect()`` together with the following elements to create assertions for
the BokehJS testing framework:

* ``to`` and ``be``: tokens to improve readability of assertions and connect
  elements
* ``not``: negates the following assertions
* ``throw``: asserts that an error is thrown. Accepts the following optional
  parameters: ``error_type`` (filter by ``Error``) and ``pattern`` (filter by
  regular expression or string).
* ``equal``: asserts (deep) value equality. Expects an operand to compare to.
* ``similar``: asserts similarity within a defined tolerance, based on the same
  value equality as ``equal``. Expects an operand to compare to as well as an
  optional ``number`` as ``tolerance``.
* ``identical``: asserts strict equality (``===``). Expects an operand to
  compare to.
* ``instanceof``: asserts that the tested element is an instance of the given
  constructor. Expects a ``Constructor`` to test against.
* ``undefined``: asserts strict equality (``===``) to ``undefined``
* ``null``: asserts strict equality (``===``) to ``null``
* ``true``: asserts strict equality (``===``) to ``true``
* ``false``: asserts strict equality (``===``) to ``false``
* ``NaN``: asserts that the tested element is ``NaN``
* ``empty``: asserts a length of ``0`` (for example, an empty string or an
  iterable that does not contain any retrievable values)
* ``below``: asserts that the tested element is below (``<``) a value. Expects a
  ``number`` to compare to.
* ``above``: asserts that the tested element is below (``>``) a value. Expects a
  ``number`` to compare to.

For example:

.. code-block:: TypeScript

    expect(m.name).to.be.null
    expect(grid0).to.be.instanceof(Column)
    expect(h.msgid).to.not.be.equal(h2.msgid)

.. _contributor_guide_writing_tests_bokehjs_visual:

BokehJS visual tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:term:`BokehJS` uses visual regression tests as integration tests. These
baseline comparison tests help make sure that Bokeh's visual output is
consistent with the output expected by design. Any BokehJS-related pull requests
that result in changes to the visual output generated by BokehJS should include
visual baseline comparison tests.

In the background, the BokehJS testing framework runs a headless browser and
takes screenshots of the browser's output. The testing framework then compares
the visual output to each test's individual baseline files.

Each test in ``test:integration`` consists of two types of baseline comparisons:

Textual baseline comparison
    For each test, the testing framework compares the pixel location of certain
    elements in the visual output to pixel locations in the baseline data. This
    baseline data is stored as plain text in each test's respective ``.blf``
    file.

Visual baseline comparison
    For each test, the testing framework does a pixel-by-pixel comparison of a
    screenshot and a baseline image. These baseline images are stored as
    ``.png`` files. In contrast to textual baseline comparisons, visual baseline
    comparisons are platform-dependent. Even minor differences in font
    rendering, for example, will make the pixel-by-pixel comparison fail.

The visual baseline comparison tests are located in the
:bokeh-tree:`bokehjs/test/integration/` folder and sub-folders.
:ref:`Bokeh's CI <contributor_guide_testing_ci>` runs these tests on Linux,
macOS, and Windows environments. The baseline files for each environment are
located in the :bokeh-tree:`bokehjs/test/baselines/` folder.

Follow these steps to write new visual tests or update existing tests:

1. Create or update visual testing scripts:
    To write a visual test for the BokehJS testing framework, start by importing
    the ``display()`` and ``fig()`` functions from the testing framework's
    ``_util`` module (located in :bokeh-tree:`bokehjs/test/integration/`):

    .. code-block:: TypeScript

        import {display, fig} from "./_util"

    When writing tests, replace the standard BokehJS ``show()`` function with
    the ``display()`` function in ``_util``. The ``display()`` function accepts
    the same arguments as ``show()`` but also captures the visual output for
    comparison.

    Similarly, replace the standard BokehJS ``figure()`` function with the
    ``fig()`` function in ``_util``. The ``fig()`` function expects an array of
    ``[width, height]`` as the first argument, followed by the same arguments as
    ``figure()``. However, to keep visual tests as efficient as possible, you
    should only use ``width`` and ``height`` wherever you can.

    Keep the width and height of your testing plot as small as possible while
    still being able to see the details you want to test with the naked eye. Try
    to keep the number of elements on your plot to a minimum.

    Follow this general pattern for visual tests:

    .. code-block:: TypeScript

        describe("Your Object", () => {
          it("should show certain behavior", async () => {
            const p = fig([width, height], {figure_attrs})

            ...

            await display(p)
          })
        })

    To change the sensitivity of a visual test, you have the option to set a
    threshold value. The threshold value represents the amounts of pixels by
    which a test image can differ from the baseline image before a test fails.
    To set a threshold value, use ``it.allowing(threshold)``. For example:

    .. code-block:: TypeScript

        describe("Your Object", () => {
          it.allowing(16)("should show certain behavior", async () => {

    Always run ``node make lint`` before committing TypeScript files.

2. Run tests locally:
    Run ``node make tests`` to test your changes on your system. To only run
    integration tests, use ``node make test:integration``.

    If you want to run a specific test only, use the ``-k`` argument and supply
    a search string. The search string is case-sensitive. The BokehJS testing
    framework tries to match your search string to the strings defined in the
    code's ``describe()`` and ``it()`` functions. For example:

    .. code-block:: sh

        $ node make test:integration -k 'Legend annotation'

    The first time you run a new or updated visual test, the BokehJS testing
    framework will notify you that baseline files are missing or outdated. At
    this point, it will also generate all missing or outdated baseline files for
    your operating system. The baseline files will be in a subfolder of
    :bokeh-tree:`bokehjs/test/baselines/`.

    Use the BokehJS :ref:`devtools server
    <contributor_guide_testing_local_javascript_devtools>` to review your local
    test results. Optionally, you can use any PNG viewer to inspect the
    generated PNG files. Adjust your testing code until the test's visual output
    matches your expectations.

3. Generate CI baselines and commit test:
    As a final step before pushing your visual tests to Bokeh's GitHub
    repository, you need to generate and commit the baseline files using
    :ref:`Bokeh's CI <contributor_guide_testing_ci>`.

    The baseline files are platform-dependent. This is why the CI will only work
    reliably if you upload baseline files that were created by the CI, not
    locally created files.

    Before generating new baseline images with Bokeh's CI, `rebase`_ your branch
    to make sure all tests are up to date.

    Follow these steps to generate the necessary baseline files and upload them
    to Bokeh's CI:

    1. Push your changes to GitHub and wait for CI to finish.
    2. The CI will expectedly fail because baseline images are either missing
       (in case you created new tests) or outdated (in case you updated existing
       tests).
    3. After the CI has finished running, go to Bokeh's GitHubCI_ page. Find
       the most recent test run for your PR and download the associated
       ``bokehjs-report`` artifact.
    4. Unzip the downloaded artifact file into the root folder of your local
       Bokeh repository.
    5. Use the :ref:`devtools server
       <contributor_guide_testing_local_javascript_devtools>` to review the
       baseline files the CI has created for each platform: first, go to
       ``/integration/report?platform=linux``, then to
       ``/integration/report?platform=macos``, and finally to
       ``/integration/report?platform=windows``.
    6. If you did not detect any unintentional differences, commit all new or
       modified ``*.blf`` and ``*.png`` files from the folders
       :bokeh-tree:`bokehjs/test/baselines/linux`,
       :bokeh-tree:`bokehjs/test/baselines/macos`, and
       :bokeh-tree:`bokehjs/test/baselines/windows`.
    7. Push your changes to GitHub again and verify that the tests pass this
       time.

.. note::
    Make sure to only push baseline files to the CI that the CI created for
    your specific pull request. Do not include any locally created baseline
    files in your pull request.

    After downloading and unpacking the baseline files from the CI, check your
    local :bokeh-tree:`bokehjs/test/baselines` directory for any modified files
    that are not part of your changes. Make sure only to commit baseline files
    that are necessary for your pull request. Reset the ``baselines`` directory
    after every failed test run with ``git clean`` or ``git clean -f``.

    If you encounter any problems with the steps described here, feel free to
    get in touch at the `Bokeh Discourse`_ or `Bokeh's contributor
    Slack`_.


.. _contributor_guide_writing_tests_bokehjs_regression:

BokehJS regression tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Additionally, :term:`BokehJS` uses regression tests with its unit and
integration tests. Regression tests are located in
:bokeh-tree:`bokehjs/test/unit/regressions.ts` and
:bokeh-tree:`bokehjs/test/integration/regressions.ts`.

You should add a regression test whenever you fix a bug related to BokehJS.
Write your regression test so that it fails in case the bug you fixed occurs
again.

Add your testing function to the outermost ``describe()`` function that has
``"Bug"`` passed to it as its ``description`` argument. Add the bug's issue
number to your test's ``describe()`` function and provide a short description of
the fixed bug in your ``it()`` function.

For example:

.. code-block:: TypeScript

      describe("in issue #9522", () => {
        it("disallows arrow to be positioned correctly in stacked layouts", async () => {

          ...

          await display(row([p1, p2]))
        })
      })

.. _contributor_guide_writing_tests_examples:

Working with examples tests
---------------------------

Bokeh's example tests are based on examples found in the :bokeh-tree:`examples`
and :bokeh-tree:`sphinx/source/docs/user_guide/examples` folders.

When you add a new example to one of these folders, they are usually
included in the examples tests automatically. Edit
:bokeh-tree:`tests/examples.yaml` to explicitly include or exclude specific
examples.

See :ref:`contributor_guide_testing_local_examples` for more information on
running the examples tests.
