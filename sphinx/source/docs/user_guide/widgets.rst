Bokeh provides a number of widgets to create interactive data-backed dashboards.

There are several examples available: `glyphs <https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/blob/master/examples/glyphs/glyphs.py>`_, `widgets server <https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/blob/master/examples/glyphs/widgets_server.py>`_,  `table server <https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/blob/master/examples/glyphs/table_server.ipynb>`_, `app reveal <https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/blob/master/examples/embed/app_reveal.py>`_ and `population <https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/blob/master/examples/glyphs/population_server.py>`_. You can use these examples as a starting point for your projects.

.. warning::
    These features are still under heavy development and considered somewhat experimental.
    Interfaces may change in future releases. Expect additional documentation soon, as
    APIs stabilize.
