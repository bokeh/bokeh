Bokeh provides a number of widgets to create interactive data-backed dashboards.

There are several examples available:
`glyphs <https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/blob/master/examples/glyphs/glyphs.py>`_,
`widgets server <https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/blob/master/examples/glyphs/widgets_server.py>`_,
`table server <https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/blob/master/examples/glyphs/data_tables.ipynb>`_,
`app reveal <https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/blob/master/examples/embed/slideshow/app_reveal.py>`_ and
`population <https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/blob/master/examples/glyphs/population_server.py>`_.
You can use these examples as a starting point for your projects.

.. warning::
    These features are still under heavy development and considered somewhat experimental.
    Interfaces may change in future releases. Expect additional documentation soon, as
    APIs stabilize.
