Linking Plots
-------------

It's often useful to link plots to add connected interactivity between plots.
This section shows an easy way to do it using the |bokeh.plotting| interface.

Linked Panning
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It's often desired to link pan or zooming actions across many plots. All that is
needed to enable this feature is to share range objects between |figure|
calls.

Now you have learned how to link panning between multiple plots with the
|bokeh.plotting| interface.

.. _userguide_interaction_linked_brushing:

Linked Brushing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Linked brushing in Bokeh is expressed by sharing data sources between glyph
renderers. This is all Bokeh needs to understand that selections acted on one
glyph must pass to all other glyphs that share that same source. To see how linked
selection extends to glyph renderers that plot only a subset of data from a data
source, see :ref:`userguide_data_linked_selection_with_filtering`.

The following code shows an example of linked brushing between circle glyphs on
two different |figure| calls.

.. |bokeh.plotting| replace:: :ref:`bokeh.plotting <bokeh.plotting>`
