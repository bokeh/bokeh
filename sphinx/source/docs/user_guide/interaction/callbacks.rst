JavaScript Callbacks
--------------------

While the main goal of Bokeh is to provide a path to create rich interactive
visualizations in the browser, purely from python, there will always be
specialized use-cases that are outside the capabilities of the core library.
For this reason, Bokeh provides different ways for users to supply custom
JavaScript when necessary, so that users may add custom or specialized
behaviours in response to property changes and other events.

One mechanism is the ability to add entire new custom extension models,
as described in :ref:`userguide_extensions`. However it is also possible
to supply small snippets of JavaScript as callbacks to use, e.g when property
values change, or when UI or other events occur. This kind of callback can be
used to add interesting interactions to Bokeh documents without the need to
use a Bokeh server (but can also be used in conjunction with a Bokeh server).

.. warning::
    The explicit purpose of these callbacks is to embed *raw JavaScript
    code* for a browser to execute. If any part of the code is derived from
    untrusted user inputs, then you must take appropriate care to sanitize
    the user input prior to passing to Bokeh.

.. _userguide_interaction_jscallbacks_customjs:

CustomJS Callbacks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To supply a snippet of JavaScript code that should be executed (in the
browser) when some event occurs, use the ``CustomJS`` model:

.. code:: python

    from bokeh.models.callbacks import CustomJS

    callback = CustomJS(args=dict(xr=plot.x_range), code="""

    // JavaScript code goes here

    var a = 10;

    // the model that triggered the callback is cb_obj:
    var b = cb_obj.value;

    // models passed as args are automagically available
    xr.start = a;
    xr.end = b;

    """)

Note that in addition to the ``code`` property, ``CustomJS`` also accepts
an ``args`` property that maps string names to Bokeh models. Any Bokeh
models that are configured in ``args`` (on the "Python side") will
automatically be available to the JavaScript code by the corresponding name.
Additionally, the model that triggers the callback (i.e. the model that
the callback is attached to) will be available as ``cb_obj``.

.. _userguide_interaction_jscallbacks_customjs_properties:

CustomJS for Model Property Events
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These ``CustomJS`` callbacks can be attached to property change events on
any Bokeh model, using the ``js_on_change`` method of Bokeh models:

.. code:: python

    p = figure()

    # execute a callback whenever p.x_range.start changes
    p.x_range.js_on_change('start', callback)

It should be mentioned that the first parameter to ``js_on_change`` is the
name of actually the name of a BokehJS event. The full format for a property
change event is, e.g. ``"change:start"`` but Bokeh will automatically
convert any property name into one of these BokehJS change events for you.
Additionally, some Bokeh models have additional specialized events. For
example, the ``ColumnDataSource`` also supports ``"patch"`` and ``"stream"``
events, for executing ``CustomJS`` callbacks whenever the data source is
patched or streamed to.

Below is an example that shows how to attach a ``CustomJS`` callback to a
``Slider`` widget, so that whenever the slider value updates, the callback
is executed to update some data:

.. bokeh-plot:: docs/user_guide/examples/interaction_callbacks_js_on_change.py
    :source-position: above

.. _userguide_interaction_jscallbacks_customjs_interactions:

CustomJS for User Interaction Events
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In addition to responding to property change events using js_on_change, Bokeh
allows CustomJS callbacks to be triggered by specific interaction events with
the plot canvas, on button click events, and on LOD events.

These event callbacks are defined on models using the js_on_event method,
with the callback receiving the event object as a locally defined cb_obj
variable:

.. code:: python

    from bokeh.models.callbacks import CustomJS

    callback = CustomJS(code="""
    // the event that triggered the callback is cb_obj:
    // The event type determines the relevant attributes
    console.log('Tap event occured at x-position: ' + cb_obj.x)
    """)

    p = figure()
    # execute a callback whenever the plot canvas is tapped
    p.js_on_event('tap', callback)

The event can be specified as a string such as ``'tap'`` above, or an event
class import from the ``bokeh.events`` module
(i.e. ``from bokeh.events import Tap``).

The following code imports ``bokeh.events`` and registers all of the
available event classes using the ``display_event`` function in order to
generate the ``CustomJS`` objects. This function is used to update the ``Div``
with the event name (always accessible from the ``event_name``
attribute) as well as all the other applicable event attributes. The
result is a plot that when interacted with, displays the corresponding
event on the right:

.. bokeh-plot:: docs/user_guide/examples/js_events.py
    :source-position: above

CustomJS for Specialized Events
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In addition to the generic mechanisms described above for adding ``CustomJS``
callbacks to Bokeh models, there are also a some Bokeh models that have a
``.callback`` property specifically for executing ``CustomJS`` in response
to specific events or situations.

.. warning::
    The callbacks described below were added early to Bokeh in an ad-hoc
    fashion. Many of them can be accomplished with the generic mechanism
    described above, and as such, may be deprecated in favor of the generic
    mechanism in the future.

CustomJS for Widgets
''''''''''''''''''''

Bokeh lets you express even more advanced callbacks that must be called on
the Javascript side in order to add custom logic and interactivity when a
widget is used. For instance, we may want to change the data of a plot when
a user clicks on a button or changes a slider Widget.

Custom callbacks like these can be set using a CustomJS object and passing it
as the ``callback`` argument to a Widget object.

The code below shows an example of CustomJS set on a slider Widget that
changes the source of a plot when the slider is used.

CustomJS for Tools
''''''''''''''''''

Bokeh allows for some tool events to trigger custom Javascript callbacks that
have access to the tool's attributes. Below, a callback on the BoxSelectTool
uses the selection box dimensions (accessed in the geometry field of the
cb_data object that is injected into the Callback code attribute), in order to
add a Rect glyph to the plot with identical dimensions.

.. bokeh-plot:: docs/user_guide/examples/interaction_callbacks_for_tools.py
    :source-position: above

CustomJS for Selections
'''''''''''''''''''''''

Bokeh also provides the means to specify the same kind of callback to be
executed whenever a selection changes. As a simple demonstration, the example
below simply copies selected points on the first plot to the second. However,
more sophisticated actions and computations are easily constructed in a
similar way.

.. bokeh-plot:: docs/user_guide/examples/interaction_callbacks_for_selections.py
    :source-position: above

Another more sophisticated example is shown below. It computes the average `y`
value of any selected points (including multiple disjoint selections), and draws
a line through that value.

.. bokeh-plot:: docs/user_guide/examples/interaction_callbacks_for_selections_lasso_mean.py
    :source-position: above

CustomJS for Hover
''''''''''''''''''

The HoverTool has a callback which comes with two pieces of built-in data: the
`index`, and the `geometry`. The `index` is the indices of any points that the
hover tool is over.

.. bokeh-plot:: docs/user_guide/examples/interaction_callbacks_for_hover.py
    :source-position: above

CustomJS for Range Update
'''''''''''''''''''''''''

With Bokeh, ranges have a callback attribute that accept a Callback instance
and execute javascript code on range updates that are triggered by tool
interactions such as a box zoom, wheel scroll or pan.

.. bokeh-plot:: docs/user_guide/examples/interaction_callbacks_for_range_update.py
    :source-position: above

CustomJS with CoffeeScript code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is possible to write the code for ``CustomJS`` callbacks in `CoffeeScript`_.
To accomplish this, use the ``from_coffeescript`` class method, which accepts
the same ``args`` and ``code`` parameters:

.. code:: python

    callback = CustomJS.from_coffeescript(args=dict(p=plot), code="""
    # coffeescript code here
    """)

CustomJS with a Python function
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A CustomJS callback can also be implemented as a Python function, which
is then translated to JavaScript using PScript. This makes it easier
for users to define client-side interactions without having to learn
JavaScript. To use this functionality you need the PScript library
(install with ``conda install -c conda-forge pscript`` or ``pip install pscript``).

.. warning::
    It is critical to note that **no python code is ever executed when
    a CustomJS callback is used**. This is true even when the callback is
    supplied as python code to be translated to JavaScript as described in
    this section. A ``CustomJS`` callback is only executed inside a browser
    JavaScript interpreter, and can only directly interact JavaScript data
    and functions (e.g., BokehJS models).

For more information about the subset of Python that is supported in
callbacks, see the `PScript documentation`_.

We recommend using ``window.x`` for variables specific to JavaScript
to avoid confusion and help static code analysis tools. You can add
``window`` as an argument to the callback function to help readability
(and pyflakes), as in the example below.

.. code-block:: python

    from bokeh.layouts import column
    from bokeh.models import CustomJS, ColumnDataSource, Slider
    from bokeh.plotting import Figure, output_file, show

    output_file("callback.html")

    x = [x*0.005 for x in range(0, 200)]
    y = x

    source = ColumnDataSource(data=dict(x=x, y=y))

    plot = Figure(plot_width=400, plot_height=400)
    plot.line('x', 'y', source=source, line_width=3, line_alpha=0.6)

    def callback(source=source, window=None):
        data = source.data
        f = cb_obj.value
        x, y = data['x'], data['y']
        for i in range(len(x)):
            y[i] = window.Math.pow(x[i], f)
        source.change.emit()

    slider = Slider(start=0.1, end=4, value=1, step=.1, title="power",
                    callback=CustomJS.from_py_func(callback))

    layout = column(slider, plot)

    show(layout)

OpenURL
~~~~~~~

Opening an URL when users click on a glyph (for instance a circle marker) is
a very popular feature. Bokeh lets users enable this feature by exposing an
OpenURL callback object that can be passed to a Tap tool in order to have that
action called whenever the users clicks on the glyph.

The following code shows how to use the OpenURL action combined with a TapTool
to open an URL whenever the user clicks on a circle.

.. bokeh-plot:: docs/user_guide/examples/interaction_open_url.py
    :source-position: above

Please note that ``OpenURL`` callbacks specifically and only work with
``TapTool``, and are only invoked when a glyph is hit. That is, they do not
execute on every tap. If you would like to execute a callback on every
mouse tap, please see :ref:`userguide_interaction_jscallbacks_customjs_interactions`.
