Using ``bokeh`` Commands
========================

It is possible to generate various kinds of output from Bokeh
programmatically. The use of ``output_file``, ``output_notebook``, etc.
has been demonstrated previously in many areas of the User Guide.
However, Bokeh also provides a command line tool ``bokeh`` that can
often offer a more flexible way to generate different kinds of output
from the same source code, as well as making it easier to and faster
to iterate.
