Using the command line
======================

You can produce a wide range of Bokeh outputs programmatically
with functions such as :func:`~bokeh.io.output_file` and
:func:`~bokeh.io.output_notebook`.

However, this isn't the only way to work with the library. The ``bokeh`` command
line tool often offers better flexibility and makes iteration easier and faster.

See :ref:`bokeh.command` for more information.
