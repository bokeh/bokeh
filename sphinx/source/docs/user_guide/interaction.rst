:ref:`userguide_interaction_linking`
    Bokeh makes it simple to add certain kinds of linked interactions between
    plots, such as linked ranges when panning and zooming, or linked
    highlighting when making selections.

:ref:`userguide_interaction_legends`
    Bokeh ``Legends`` can be configured to allow for easily hiding or muting
    corresponding glyphs.

:ref:`userguide_interaction_widgets`
    Bokeh comes with a rich set of widgets that can be used with either
    client-side JavaScript callbacks, or with real python code in a Bokeh
    server application.

:ref:`userguide_interaction_jscallbacks`
    See how to attach ``CustomJS`` callbacks to various widgets and events
    in Bokeh documents.
