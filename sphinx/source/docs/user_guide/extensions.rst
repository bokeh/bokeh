Extending Bokeh
===============

Bokeh comes with a rich variety of built-in types that can be used to make
sophisticated interactive visualizations and data applications in the browser.
However, there are capabilities and features that users may desire, which may
not make it into the core library, either because they are too specialized, or
for lack of resources. Fortunately, it is possible to extend Bokeh by creating
custom user extensions.

* Modify the behavior of existing Bokeh models
* Add new models to connect third-party JavaScript libraries to Python
* Create highly specialized models for domain specific use-cases.

Custom extensions can be made and used with standard releases, and do not
require setting up a development environment or building anything from source.
They provide the easiest way to get involved in Bokeh development. By lowering
the bar for extending Bokeh, users are afforded the ability to "try out" new
features and functionality (which might some day be candidates for adding to
the core library) without having to wait on the core team.

.. _userguide_extensions_structure:

Structure of Bokeh Models
-------------------------

.. _userguide_extensions_structure_python:

Python Models
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For the most part, Python Bokeh models are completely declarative classes.
Custom extensions are created by making a subclass :class:`~bokeh.model.Model`
(or one of its subclasses), and including special class attributes to
declare the properties that are mirrored on the JavaScript side. All of the
available property types are documented in the :ref:`bokeh.core.properties`
section of the Reference Guide.

A small example that creates a Custom readout for a slider is presented
below:

.. code-block:: python

    from bokeh.core.properties import String, Instance
    from bokeh.models import LayoutDOM, Slider

    class Custom(LayoutDOM):

        text = String(default="Custom text")

        range = Instance(Slider)

Since we would like to create a custom extension that can participate in DOM
layout, we subclass from :class:`~bokeh.models.layouts.LayoutDOM`. We also
added two properties: a :class:`~bokeh.core.properties.String` to configure
a text message for the readout, and an :class:`~bokeh.core.properties.Instance`
that can hold a :class:`~bokeh.models.widgets.inputs.Slider`. The JavaScript
``Slider`` object that corresponds to the Python ``Slider`` will be made
available to use.

.. _userguide_extensions_structure_js:

JavaScript Models and Views
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

While the Python side is mostly declarative, without much or any real code, the
JavaScript side requires code to implement the model. When appropriate, code
for a corresponding view must also be provided. Currently BokehJS models and
views are subclasses of Models and View from the Backbone JavaScript library.

Below is an annotated JavaScript implementation for ``Custom`` and its
``CustomView``. For built-in models, this code is included directly in the
final ``bokeh.js`` library. We will see how to connect this code to custom
extensions in the next section.

.. note::
    BokehJS is largely written in `CoffeeScript`_. Accordingly, the examples
    and guidance here are presented in CoffeeScript. However, custom extensions
    can be written in pure JavaScript as well.

.. code-block:: coffeescript

    import {div, empty} from "core/dom"

    # The "core/properties" module has all the property types
    import * as p from "core/properties"

    # We will subclass in JavaScript from the same class that was subclassed
    # from in Python
    import {LayoutDOM, LayoutDOMView} from "models/layouts/layout_dom"

    # This model will actually need to render things, so we must provide
    # view. The LayoutDOM model has a view already, so we will start with that
    export class CustomView extends LayoutDOMView

      initialize: (options) ->
        super(options)

        @render()

        # Set Backbone listener so that when the Bokeh slider has a change
        # event, we can process the new data
        @listenTo(@model.slider, 'change', () => @render())

      render: () ->
        # Backbone Views create <div> elements by default, accessible as @el.
        # Many Bokeh views ignore this default <div>, and instead do things
        # like draw to the HTML canvas. In this case though, we change the
        # contents of the <div>, based on the current slider value.
        empty(@el)
        @el.appendChild(div({
          style: {
            color: '#686d8e'
            'background-color': '#2a3153'
          }
        }, "#{@model.text}: #{@model.slider.value}"))

    export class Custom extends LayoutDOM

      # If there is an associated view, this is boilerplate.
      default_view: CustomView

      # The ``type`` class attribute should generally match exactly the name
      # of the corresponding Python class.
      type: "Custom"

      # The @define block adds corresponding "properties" to the JS model. These
      # should basically line up 1-1 with the Python model class. Most property
      # types have counterparts, e.g. bokeh.core.properties.String will be
      # p.String in the JS implementation. Where the JS type system is not yet
      # as rich, you can use p.Any as a "wildcard" property type.
      @define {
        text:   [ p.String ]
        slider: [ p.Any    ]
      }

.. _userguide_extensions_structure_putting_together:

Putting it Together
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For built-in Bokeh models, the implementation in BokehJS is automatically
matched with the corresponding Python model by the build process. In order
connect JavaScript implementations to Python models, one additional step
is needed. The Python class should have have a class attribute called
``__implementation__`` whose value is the JavaScript (or CoffeeScript) code
that the defined the client-side model (and optional view).

Assuming the CoffeeScript code above was saved in a file ``custom.coffee``,
then the complete Python class might look like:

.. code-block:: python

    from bokeh.core.properties import String, Instance
    from bokeh.models import LayoutDOM, Slider

    class Custom(LayoutDOM):

        __implementation__ = "custom.coffee"

        text = String(default="Custom text")

        slider = Instance(Slider)

Then, if this class is defined in a Python module ``custom.py`` then the custom
extension can now be used exactly like any built-in Bokeh model:

.. code-block:: python

    from bokeh.io import show
    from bokeh.layouts import column
    from bokeh.models import Slider

    from custom import Custom

    slider = Slider(start=0, end=10, step=0.1, value=0, title="value")

    custom = Custom(text="Special Slider Display", slider=slider)

    layout = column(slider, custom)

    show(layout)

Which results in the output below. The JavaScript code for the implementation
is automatically included in the rendered document. Scrub the slider to see
the special header update as the slider moves:

.. bokeh-plot:: docs/user_guide/examples/extensions_putting_together.py
    :source-position: none

.. _userguide_extensions_supplying_external_resources:

Supplying External Resources
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As part of implementing a custom model in Bokeh, there may be the need to
include third-party javascript libraries or css resources. Bokeh supports
supplying external resources through the Python class attributes
``__javascript__`` and ``__css__`` of custom models.

Including the URL paths to external resources will causes Bokeh to add
the resources to the html document head, causing the Javascript library to be
available in the global namespace and the custom CSS styling to be applied.

One example is including the JS and CSS files for `KaTex`_ (a
Javascript-based typesetting library that supports LaTex) in order to create
a ``LaTexLabel`` custom model.

.. code-block:: python

    class LatexLabel(Label):
        """A subclass of the Bokeh built-in `Label` that supports rendering
        LaTex using the KaTex typesetting library.
        """
        __javascript__ = "https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/KaTeX/0.6.0/katex.min.js"
        __css__ = "https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/KaTeX/0.6.0/katex.min.css"
        __implementation__ = """
        # do something here
        """

See the LaTex example in the extensions gallery below to see the full
implementation and resulting output.

.. _userguide_extensions_structure_server_integration:

Integration with Bokeh Server
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

No special work or modification is needed to integrate custom user extensions
with the Bokeh server. As for standalone documents, the JavaScript
implementation is automatically included in the rendered application.
Additionally the standard synchronization of Bokeh model properties that
happens for all built-in models happens transparently for custom user
extensions as well.

.. _userguide_extensions_examples:

Examples
--------

Here we present some complete examples to serve as a reference. It is hoped
that the information in this section is a useful point of departure for anyone
creating a custom extensions. However, creating extensions is a somewhat
advanced topic. In many cases, it will be required to study the source code
of the base classes in :bokeh-tree:`bokehjs/src/coffee/models`.

For any questions that remain, please contact any of the sources in
:ref:`userguide_info`.Collaborating with the community will help make additions
and improvements to this section for future users.
