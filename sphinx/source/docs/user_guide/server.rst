.. _userguide_server_overview:

Overview
--------

The Bokeh server is an optional component that can be used to provide
additional capabilities, such as:

* hosting and publishing Bokeh plots for wider audiences
* streaming data to plots so that they automatically update
* interactively visualizing very large datasets by employing downsampling and abstract rendering
* building and deploying dashboards and apps with sophisticated user interactions

The Bokeh server is built on top of `Flask <http://flask.pocoo.org>`_. Bokeh
ships with a standalone executable ``bokeh-server`` that you can easily run,
and you can also embed the Bokeh server functionality inside another Flask
server using the Bokeh Server `Flask Blueprint <http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/blueprints/>`_.

The basic task of the Bokeh Server is to be a mediator between the original data
and plot models created by a user, and the reflected data and plot models in the
BokehJS client:

    :align: center
    :scale: 50 %

|

Here you can see illustrated the most useful and compelling of the Bokeh server:
**full two-way communication between the original code and the BokehJS plot.**
Plots are published by sending them to the server. The data for the plot can be
updated on the server, and the client will respond and update the plot. Users can
interact with the plot through tools and widgets in the browser, then the results of
these interactions can be pulled back to the original code to inform some further
query or analysis (possibly resulting in updates pushed back the plot).

We will explore the capabilities afforded by the Bokeh server in detail below.

.. _userguide_server_authentication:

Authentication
--------------
Bokeh defaults to single user mode - where every request is automatically logged in as a user with username ``defaultuser``.  However for teams, and for plot publishing, it makes more sense to add an authentication layer.  This way users won't be able to overwrite each other's plots.

To do enable multi user mode, You need to turn on the ``multi_user`` bokeh server setting.  This can be done using the command line parameter ``-m``.  Once this is done, all scripts that use the bokeh server must authenticate with the bokeh server.  A user can be created with::

    session = Session(root_url=url)
    session.register(username, password)

Or logged in with::

    session = Session(root_url=url)
    session.login(username, password)

The bokeh client library will store authentication keys in the ``~/.bokeh`` directory, so that in subsequent invocations, logging in is not necessary

.. _userguide_server_hosting:

Plot Hosting
------------

For plot hosting, we generally recommend running the server in multi user mode.  See the Authentication section for instructions on how to do this.

Once a plot is created, you have to publish it.  Assuming you have a session that is authenticated against a document::

    session = Session()
    session.use_doc('mydocument')
    #do some plots here
    session.publish()

Or if you are using ``output_server``::

    output_server('myplot')
    #make some plots
    cursession().publish()

A public link to a plot on the bokeh server page can be viewed by append ``?public=true`` To the url - for example if you have the url to a plot ``http://localhost:5006/bokeh/doc/some-doc-id/some-plot-id``, You can generate a public link to the published plot using ``http://localhost:5006/bokeh/doc/some-doc-id/some-plot-id?public=true``.   In addition, the ``autoload_server`` function call in ``bokeh.embed`` also takes a ``public=true`` keyword argument, which will generate an embeddable html snippet that will load the public version of a given plot


.. _userguide_server_streaming:

Streaming Data
--------------



.. _userguide_server_large:

Large Data
----------
This feature is currenlty in beta.  Bokeh supports large datasets via the blaze, combined with a few abstract rendering and smart downsampling routines.  Bokeh currently pulls in the blaze server as a flask blueprint - so if you have the necessary libraries installed, your bokeh server is also a blaze server.

Blaze Server
------------

To use the smart downsampling facilities of bokeh, you must install the multi-user blaze server, https://github.com/ContinuumIO/multiuserblazeserver.::

    $ conda install -c bokeh multiuserblazeserver

or::

    $ pip install multiuserblazeserver

The blaze server is a bit mis-named at the moment, it supports a pluggable authentication model however currently only the single user authentication backend is implemented.  There are 2 categories of data defined in the blaze server - data owned by the server itself, and data owned by individual users.  Data owned by the server is read only.  Data owned by individual users can be modified by the user that owns it, but is readable by everyone.

To configure server owned data, you pass it a configuration file (a python file) which defines a data parameter - this should be a dictionary of anything blaze can understand(pandas dataframes, hdf5 files, numpy arrays, etc..).  User defined data is configured by users in a 2 stage process.  First, uploading files into the servers data directory, and then configuring that resources.  These examples are written against the single user authentication backend, which is why the username is "defaultuser"::

    from mbs.client import upload, configure
    upload('http://localhost:5006/', 'mydata.hdf5')
    configure('hdfstore://defaultuser/mydata.hdf5')

or::

    from mbs.client import upload, configure
    upload('http://localhost:5006/', 'data.csv')
    configure('defaultuser/data.csv', sep="/t")

Once datasets are loaded into blaze, they can be accessed via the blaze client::

    from blaze.server.client import Client
    from blaze import Data
    c = Client('http://localhost:5006/')
    d = Data(c)
    table = d['hdfstore://defaultuser/mydata.hdf5']

Bokeh Integration
-----------------

Bokeh imports the blaze server as a flask blueprint ( so it is part of the bokeh server), and adds one more route, a render route which is used by bokehjs for server side data transforms, like `Abstract Rendering <ar.html>`_. or a variety of downsampling routines.

To use a blaze data source in a Bokeh plot execute the following::

    ## Assume you have a blaze array bound to a variable table
    source = ServerDataSource()
    source.from_blaze(table, local=True)

The local parameter tells bokeh that the blaze server running inside the bokeh serer contains the data in question.  In the future, it will be possible to specify other blaze servers, however this is currently not implemented.

Support for this is currently limited to plots generated through the `plotting.py` API.  There are further glyph restrictions for abstract rendering enumerated `here <ar.html>`_.
In terms of downsampling, we have the capability of performing max-min decimation for horizontal line plots, as well as naive downsampling of images/heatmaps.

Please see the following examples:

-  `plotting/server/blaze_source.py <https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/blob/master/examples/plotting/server/blaze_source.py>`_
-  `plotting/server/abstractrender.py <https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/blob/master/examples/plotting/server/abstractrender.py>`_
-  `plotting/server/line_downsample.py <https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/blob/master/examples/plotting/server/line_downsample.py>`_
-  `plotting/server/image_downsample.py <https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/blob/master/examples/plotting/server/image_downsample.py>`_

.. _userguide_server_command_line:

Command Line Configuration
--------------------------

General Usage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``bokeh-server`` application has some command line options for
general usage, setting the server port and IP, for instance:

.. option:: -h, --help

    show this help message and exit

.. option:: --ip <IP>

    IP address that the bokeh server will listen on (default: 127.0.0.1)

.. option:: --port <PORT>

    port that the bokeh server will listen on (default: 5006)

.. option:: --url-prefix <URL_PREFIX>

    URL prefix for server. e.g. 'host:port/<prefix>/bokeh' (default: None)

Advanced Usage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Additional configuration options for configuring server data sources,
multi-user operation, scripts, etc:

.. option:: -D <DATA_DIRECTORY>, --data-directory <DATA_DIRECTORY>

    location for server data sources

.. option:: -m, --multi-user

    start in multi-user configuration (default: False)

.. option:: --script <SCRIPT>

    script to load (for applets)

Storage Backends
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Bokeh server supports various different backends for data storage:

* In-Memory --- non-persistent, useful for testing
* `Shelve <https://docs.python.org/2/library/shelve.html>`_ --- lightweight, available on all platforms
* `Redis <http://redis.io>`_ --- recommended for production deployments

.. note::
    Redis can be more difficult to install on Windows, please consult
    :ref:`install_windows` for some additional notes.

Additional backends may be added in the future if need or demand arises, or
if they are contributed by the community.

You can specify the backend when starting the Bokeh server by supplying
the ``--backend`` command line argument:

.. option:: --backend <BACKEND>

    storage backend: [ redis | memory | shelve ] (default: shelve)

For example::

    $ bokeh-server --backend=memory

When using the ``redis`` backend there are some additional options
available:

.. option:: --redis-port <REDIS_PORT>

    port for redis server to listen on (default: 7001)

.. option:: --start-redis

    start redis automatically

.. option:: --no-start-redis

    do not start redis automatically

By default ``bokeh-server`` will start Redis automatically when the
``redis`` backend is chosen.

Websockets
~~~~~~~~~~

The Bokeh server uses websockets for communication between the server
and browser clients. There are several options for configuring the
use of websockets:

.. option:: --ws-conn-string <WS_CONN_STRING>

    connection string for websocket (unnecessary if auto-starting)

.. option:: --zmqaddr <ZMQADDR>

    ZeroMQ URL

Typically these values do not require much attention. By default,
``bokeh-server`` automatically starts a ZeroMQ websocket worker.

Development Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. option:: -d, --debug

    use debug mode for Flask

.. option:: --dev

    run server in development mode: -js --backend=memory

.. option:: --filter-logs

    don't show 'GET /static/... 200 OK', useful with --splitjs

.. option:: -j, --debugjs

    serve BokehJS files from the bokehjs build directory in the source tree

.. option:: -s, --splitjs

    serve individual JS files instead of compiled bokeh.js, requires --debugjs

.. option:: --robust-reload

    protect debug server reloading from syntax errors

.. option:: -v, --verbose
