Learning More
=============

Hopefully this User Guide gets you started with the basics of using Bokeh.

For detailed information about all modules, classes, models, and objects,
consult the :ref:`refguide`. If you are interested in learning how to build
and develop Bokeh, or for information about how to create a new language
binding, see the :ref:`devguide`.

To see ready-made examples of how you might use Bokeh with your own data,
check out the :ref:`gallery` on the main documentation site, as well as
the `Bokeh NBViewer Gallery`_.

For questions and technical assistance, come join the `Bokeh mailing list`_.

Visit the `Bokeh GitHub repository`_ and try the examples.
