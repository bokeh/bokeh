.. warning::
    The basic plotting interface was originally conceived as a stateful,
    Matlab-style interface. After some experience, it is evident that this
    kind of interface is not ideal, especially in conjunction with the IPython
    notebook. While most of the material in this section will remain unaffected,
    some aspects of this ``plotting.py`` interface will change in an upcoming
    Bokeh releases.
