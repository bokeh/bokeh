Roadmap & TODO List
###################

v0.5 (Goal: March 2014)
=======================

* StreamDataSource which automatically, periodically polls a datasource (need to some way highlight data APIs which support CORS; consider using JSONP?)
* Better grid-based layout system; use Cassowary.js for layout solver, and initially just directly implement schematized layouts
* Integrate Abstract Rendering into bokeh server
* New event and interactor architecture
* Data selection architecture, add various inspectors and data selectors (accessible from Python interface)
* Improve rendering loop performance in BokehJS
* Improved annotations and legends
* Frame around plots for consistent look & feel on all Bokeh plots
* Basic widgets
* Better map projections
* Better integration with Matplotlib pylab plotting functions
* Improve ggplot interface / integrate with ggplot python lib
* Touch events
* Animation framework
* CSS styling/theming mechanism
* Hot corner for resize tool

v0.6 (Goal: May 2014)
=====================

Long-term TODO List
===================

Core Plotting
-------------

* Axis improvements

  * Improved datetime axis
  * minor ticks
  * good ticking & tick formatting for lat/long axes

* Annotations

  * Arrows, text boxes
  * Improve legend

* graphs/trees
* map projections
* better save capability
* offscreen render, size choice
* Abstract Rendering server
* computed columns, for:

  * stacking bars and areas easily
  * jitter, etc

* streaming data sources
* support for Blaze remote arrays
* publishing support for bokeh-server
* bindings in other languages


Backends
--------

* more efficient binary data transfers to BokehJS
* Check compatibility with mobile browsers


Interactions
------------

* additional selection and inspection tools
* decouple selection reporting from highlighting or other policies
* more general selections (point, line, box, poly, circle)


Code Cleanup
------------

* should use html templates in some places
* css files have lots of cruft

Docs & Testing
--------------

* tests: Unit tests, image comparisons for regression
* better docs/interactive gallery
* demo improvements

  * code simplification
  * option for static page generation
  * more demos
