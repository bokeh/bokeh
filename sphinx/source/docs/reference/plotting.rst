bokeh.plotting
==============

The ``bokeh.plotting`` API is Bokeh's **primary** interface, and lets you focus
on relating glyphs to data. It automatically assembles plots with default
elements such as axes, grids, and tools for you.

Below is a basic example:

.. bokeh-plot:: docs/user_guide/examples/concepts_plotting.py
    :source-position: above

This reference guide chapter has a few sections split out for the different
main components:

.. toctree::
    :maxdepth: 1
    :glob:

    plotting/*
