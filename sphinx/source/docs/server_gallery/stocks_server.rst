Stocks Example
==============

This example shows a dashboard that allows users to compare different
pairs of stocks. Users will se a correlation plot as as well as a data
summary. For each stock there is also a histogram and time series.
Selections are linked across plots and histograms are recomputed to
show only the distribution of the selected points.
