The User Guide is being continuously updated, but please also consult the numerous
`examples <https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/tree/master/examples>`_
to see the kinds of parameters that can be passed in to plotting functions in ``bokeh.plotting``, and look
at the `glyph examples <https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/tree/master/examples/glyphs>`_ to see
the kinds of low-level object attributes that can be set to really customize a plot.
