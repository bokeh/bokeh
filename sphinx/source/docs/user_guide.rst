topic:

:ref:`userguide_quickstart`
    Get set up and running quickly.

:ref:`userguide_setup`
    Install Bokeh and verify your installation is working correctly.

:ref:`userguide_concepts`
    Learn important foundational concepts about how Bokeh is organized.

:ref:`userguide_plotting`
    Make different kinds of plots using the simple but flexible glyph
    methods from the |bokeh.plotting| interface.

:ref:`userguide_categorical`
    Handle categorical data with a variety of different techniques such
    as bar charts, categorical heatmaps, visual dodging, and jitter.

:ref:`userguide_graph`

:ref:`userguide_geo`
    Working with geographical data---Google Maps, GeoJSON, Tile Rendering.

:ref:`userguide_compat`
    Use Bokeh together with libraries such as `Datashader`_ and  `HoloViews`_.

:ref:`userguide_annotations`
    Add informational annotations, such as labels, arrows, and legends to
    plots.

:ref:`userguide_styling`
    Customize every visual aspect of Bokeh plots---axes, grids, labels,
    glyphs, and more.

:ref:`userguide_tools`
    Make interactive tools (like pan, zoom, select, and others) available
    on your plots.

:ref:`userguide_layout`
    Combine multiple plots and widgets into specified layouts.

:ref:`userguide_export`
    Learn how to export Bokeh layouts as PNGs and SVGs.

:ref:`userguide_notebook`
    Display interactive plots inside Jupyter notebooks.

:ref:`userguide_interaction`
    Create more sophisticated interactions including widgets or linked
    panning and selection.

:ref:`userguide_cli`
    Use Bokeh's capabilites from the command line with the ``bokeh``
    command.

:ref:`userguide_server`
    Deploy the Bokeh Server to build and publish sophisticated data
    applications.

:ref:`userguide_embed`
    Embed static or server-based Bokeh plots and widgets into HTML documents
    in a variety of ways.

:ref:`userguide_webgl`
    Improve performance for large datasets by using WebGL.

:ref:`userguide_bokehjs`
    Create plots in JavaScript by using BokehJS directly.

:ref:`userguide_extensions`
    Add new capability to Bokeh with custom user extensions.

:ref:`userguide_info`
    See where to go next for more information and examples.

:ref:`userguide_tutorials`
    Read tutorials on specific topics for using Bokeh.

The examples in the user guide are written to be as minimal as possible,
while illustrating how to accomplish a single task within Bokeh. With a
handful of exceptions, no outside libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, or
Blaze are required to run the examples as written. However, Bokeh works
well with NumPy, Pandas, Blaze, or almost any array or table-like data
structure.
