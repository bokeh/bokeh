Contributing Python code
========================

The Bokeh codebase combines code written in Python and :ref:`TypeScript
<contributor_guide_bokehjs>`. This chapter provides an overview of the most
important things to know when working on Bokeh's Python code.

.. _contributor_guide_python_style:

Code style
----------

Bokeh's Python code generally follows the `PEP8`_ standard. Some notable
exceptions include:

* for consistency, use double quotation marks for strings (``"string"``)
* don't write lines that are longer than 165 characters
* write `Google Python Style Guide`_ docstrings (see
  :ref:`contributor_guide_documentation_edit_docstrings` for more information)

Bokeh uses a combination of code quality tests for each :ref:`Pull Request
<contributor_guide_pull_requests>`. Relevant tests for Python code include
`Flake8`_ and `isort`_. Use the following command to run those codebase tests
locally:

.. code-block:: sh

    pytest tests/codebase

To learn more about running those tests on your system, see
:ref:`contributor_guide_testing_local_codebase`.

.. _contributor_guide_python_tests:

Tests
-----

All :ref:`Pull Requests <contributor_guide_pull_requests>` that add or update
code should include new or updated tests. See :ref:`contributor_guide_testing`
and :ref:`contributor_guide_writing_tests` for more information on testing,
including Python-specific tests.

.. _contributor_guide_python_organization:

Source code organization
------------------------

The Bokeh repository contains Bokeh's Python code as well as the JavaScript code
of :ref:`BokehJS <contributor_guide_bokehjs>`. These are the most relevant
folders containing Python code:

``bokeh/``
  The Python code for the Bokeh library itself is located in the
  :bokeh-tree:`bokeh` folder.

  Everything that comprises a Bokeh visualization (such as
  :ref:`tools <userguide_tools>`, :term:`glyphs <Glyph>`,
  :term:`widgets <Widget>`, or :ref:`ColumnDataSources <userguide_data_cds>`) is
  based on a Bokeh model. The Python code for all models is located in
  :bokeh-tree:`bokeh/models`. See :ref:`contributor_guide_python_models` below
  for more information on models.

  Other subdirectories in this folder include:

  * :bokeh-tree:`bokeh/plotting` contains Bokeh's :ref:`plotting interface
    <userguide_interfaces_plotting>`
  * :bokeh-tree:`bokeh/colors` contains code for handling
    :ref:`colors <userguide_styling_colors>`
  * :bokeh-tree:`bokeh/embed` contains code for :ref:`embedding Bokeh content
    in web pages <userguide_embed>`.
  * :bokeh-tree:`bokeh/io` contains code for Bokeh's IO functions, such as
    :ref:`file export <userguide_export>` and :ref:`notebook output
    <userguide_jupyter>`
  * :bokeh-tree:`bokeh/palettes` contains code for Bokeh's :ref:`palettes
    <bokeh.palettes>`
  * :bokeh-tree:`bokeh/sphinxext` contains code for custom Sphinx extension
    used in :ref:`Bokeh's documentation <contributor_guide_documentation>`

  See the |reference guide| for more information on the structure of this
  directory and its subdirectories.

``examples/``
  The :bokeh-tree:`examples` folder contains examples for most of Bokeh's
  functionalities. Some of those examples are used in Bokeh's :ref:`gallery
  <gallery>`.

``tests/``
  The :bokeh-tree:`tests` folder contains Bokeh's suite of tests. See
  :ref:`contributor_guide_testing` and :ref:`contributor_guide_writing_tests`
  for more information on testing.

``typings/``
  The :bokeh-tree:`typings` folder contains `stub files`_ for Bokeh's type
  hints.

.. _contributor_guide_python_models:

Models and properties
---------------------

The central building blocks of all Bokeh visualizations are objects based on
Bokeh's :term:`models <Model>`. These models are representations of
:term:`plot <Plot>` elements, such as :ref:`axes <userguide_styling_axes>`,
:term:`glyphs <Glyph>`, or :term:`widgets <Widget>`.

On the Python side, Bokeh serializes the attributes of each plot element object
into JSON data. On the browser side, BokehJS deserializes this JSON data and
creates JavaScript objects based on this information. :term:`BokehJS` then uses
these JavaScript objects to render the visualization.

.. image:: /_images/bokeh_bokehjs.svg
    :class: image-border
    :alt: Flowchart describing the flow of data from Python objects through JSON
          to the browser-side. There, the JSON data is converted into JavaScript
          objects which then get rendered as output. Output can be HTML Canvas,
          WebGL, or SVG.
    :align: center
    :width: 100%

Whenever you update or add models in Python, you need to also :ref:`update the
corresponding TypeScript code for BokehJS <contributor_guide_bokehjs>`.

All of Bokeh's Python models are located in :bokeh-tree:`bokeh/models` and its
subfolders. They all are subclasses of :class:`~bokeh.model.Model`:

.. code-block:: python

    class SomeNewModel(Model):
        """ Some new model. """

Models contain properties, which are class attributes defined in
:class:`bokeh.core.properties`. For example:

.. code-block:: python

    class ModelWithIntProps(Model):
        prop1 = Int()
        prop2 = Int(10)

In this example, the ``ModelWithIntProps`` model represents objects that have
two integer values, ``prop1`` and ``prop2``.

Bokeh uses a wide variety of property types:

* Primitive types like :class:`~bokeh.core.properties.Byte`,
  :class:`~bokeh.core.properties.Int`, :class:`~bokeh.core.properties.Float`,
  :class:`~bokeh.core.properties.Complex`, or
  :class:`~bokeh.core.properties.String`
* Container-like properties that take other properties as parameters, such as
  :class:`~bokeh.core.properties.List` (``List(Int)``) or
  :class:`~bokeh.core.properties.Dict` (``Dict(String, Double)``)
* Specialized types like :class:`~bokeh.core.properties.Instance`
  (``Instance(Plot)``), :class:`~bokeh.core.properties.Enum`
  (``Enum("foo", "bar", "baz")``), or :class:`~bokeh.core.properties.Either`
  (``Either(Int, String)``)

These property types have several purposes:

* :ref:`type checking <contributor_guide_python_typing>` the different models
* making sure that models remain compatible between Python and JavaScript
* automatically generating some basic documentation for the |reference guide|

An example of a more realistic model might look like this:

.. code-block:: python

    class SomeModel(Model):
        prop1 = Int(127)
        prop2 = Either(Int, List(Int), Dict(String, List(Int)))
        prop3 = Enum("x", "y", "z")
        prop4 = Range(Float, 0.0, 1.0)
        prop5 = List(Instance(Range1d))

See :ref:`bokeh.core.properties` for more details.

.. warning::
    The class :class:`~bokeh.core.properties.Any` is the super-type of all other
    types and will accept any type of value. Since this circumvents all type
    validation, make sure to use it sparingly, if at all.

.. _contributor_guide_python_typing:

Typing
------

Bokeh uses two systems for type checking Python code:

* For the :ref:`system of models described above
  <contributor_guide_python_models>`, Bokeh uses its own system of
  properties. See :ref:`contributor_guide_python_models` for more information.
* For any code not using models, Bokeh uses `PEP 484
  <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/>`_ style hints. Use the Python
  standard `typing` and `typing_extensions` modules if necessary.

:ref:`Bokeh's CI <contributor_guide_testing_ci>` uses `mypy`_ to check types.
To type check your code locally, run ``mypy bokeh``.

.. note::
    In case you want to use type information with tools other than mypy (such as
    extracting information with ``typing.get_type_hints``, for example), you
    will most likely need to use Python 3.10 or later. This is because some
    of Bokeh's type hints use the ``X | Y`` syntax for union types as defined in
    `PEP 604`_.
