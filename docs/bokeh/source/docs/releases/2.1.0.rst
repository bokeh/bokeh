`Migration Guide <releases.html#release-2-1-0-migration>`__
-----------------------------------------------------------

Minimum Tornado Version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The minimum torndado version is now 5.1.

``render_mode`` deprecated
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Tool overlays are now implemented efficiently on the HTML5 canvas without any
separate CSS rendering codepath. This makes the ``render_mode`` property
obsolete. Accordingly, ``render_mode`` is deprecated (and ignored) everywhere
it currently appears, and will be removed entirely for Bokeh 3.0 in the future.
