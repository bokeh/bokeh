-----------------------------------------------------------

Additionally, note that the "implicit" plotting interface of plotting.py
has been deprecated, and will be removed in Bokeh 0.8. In a nutshell,
code such as:

.. code-block:: python

    figure()
    hold()
    line()
    circle()
    show()

Should be replaced with the more explicit code:

.. code-block:: python

    p = figure()
    p.line()
    p.circle()
    show(p)
