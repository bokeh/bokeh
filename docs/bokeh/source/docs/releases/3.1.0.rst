3.1.0
=====

Bokeh Version ``3.1.0`` (?? Feb 2023) is a minor milestone of Bokeh project.

Changes
-------

* Official support for Python 3.11 was added
* ``select_every_mousemove`` was deprecated and renamed to ``continuous``
* Internal compilation target was upgraded to ES2022. This may affect thirdparty
  extensions and custom builds of bokehjs. If you're using `noImplicitOverride: true`,
  in your ``tsconfig.json``, then at minium you will have to replace ``override``
  with ``declare`` in ``*.ts`` files in type-only contexts.
* Unset properties cannot by serialized anymore. Previously attempting to get
  a value of an unset property resuled in an exception, however serializing
  models with such properties didn't fail until at runtime in bokehjs. It's
  now required to fill-in all property values before serialization.
* `RangeTool` is not a multi `GestureTool` anymore, thus it can't be activated
  with `Toolbar.active_multi`. The tool is now active by default.
* ``RangesUpdate`` event now triggers on all linked plots instead of on the
  one that user interaction resulted in changed ranges.
