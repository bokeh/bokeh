Installing Bokeh
----------------

Bokeh is officially supported and tested on Python 3.8 and above (CPython).

You can install Bokeh with either ``conda`` or ``pip``:

.. grid:: 1 1 2 2

    .. grid-item-card::

        Installing with ``pip``
        ^^^
        Use this command to install Bokeh:

        .. code-block:: sh

            pip install bokeh

    .. grid-item-card::

        Installing with ``conda``
        ^^^
        Use this command to install Bokeh:

        .. code-block:: sh

            conda install bokeh

        Conda requires either `Anaconda`_ or `Miniconda`_ to be installed on your
        system.

For more detailed information on installing and potential problems you might
encounter, go to the :ref:`installation` section.

First steps guides
------------------

Follow these guides to quickly learn about the most important features and
capabilities of Bokeh.

The first steps guides are for anybody who is new to Bokeh. The only
prerequisites for using these guides are a basic understanding of Python and a
working :ref:`installation<first_steps_installing>` of Bokeh.

The first steps guides include lots of examples that you can copy to your
development environment. There are also many links to the more in-depth
resources of the |user guide| and |reference guide| in case you want to learn
more about any of the topics covered in the first steps guides.
